Another world destroyed by the [[Custodians]], once the home world of a sapient that was rendered basically extinct by custodian purges, the Solo People.  They were not ones to really question their opposition in [[Dozin]]'s hierarchy as they were a miserable planet bound society with seas of carbonic acid and were monopedal.  The solo folk mostly stuck to their world and did whatever the local Packmaster as expected of them not really having much reason to contest the situation.  The Custodians destroyed their world mainly because a lot of local war masters resided and harbored assets on the world believing the custodians wouldn't attack a worlds of primitives and that such world would be of good protection.  This plan fell apart because they had way too many nearby assets for such idea to be plausible and the custodians were absolute annihilators, the solo people were too tainted and the proper use of diversion had not been conceived.  The world is a sterile mess, destabilized gravitationally and on a deorbited trajectory that in a thousand years will lead the world into the parent sun of the binary system.   The word has vast fault lines.
