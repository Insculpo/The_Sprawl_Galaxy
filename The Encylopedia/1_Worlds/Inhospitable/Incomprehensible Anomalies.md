The Imurn
 
The imurn was a fundamentally peculiar strain of entity from the weaveworks.  The entities which sprang forth and about the broken plane had within a simmering strain of meshes which interwove to create their sense of being.  Their surfaces were convulsing in constant pain, this was nothing new to them.  
 
The Parching Matrix
 
The driest formation known in the galaxy, molecules that could be a solvent for light years.  No fluid, just extremely dry, leather-like world clusters.  There is not much coherent understanding as to what all this stuff was, it is just something that is.  Just a horrid dry space.    It has no real cause to exist, anyone around ends up just finding their fluids depleting.  It is a weird heat that seemingly just exists to deplete fluid.  No actual understanding of what the hell this parching matrix even is for has been gleamed.  How a pocket of the universe can have this weird evaporation factor to it remains unclear and inexplicable.  The materials found in the patching matrix however are of value, since they have hyper dry materials that can sponge up any and all kinds of fluid while depositing said fluid as either emissive gases or as a mineral deposit.  Hyper sponging is not a new concept.
