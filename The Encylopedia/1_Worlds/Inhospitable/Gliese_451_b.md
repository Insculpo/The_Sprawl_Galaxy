### Overview

Gliese 451 b is a diamond world, rich in carbon and has an exposed supercritical fluid of diamonds beneath a dense carbon monoxide atmosphere.  It's not a habitable world so much of what can be said of this world is that it is a very messy one despite its diamond rich composition.  Worlds like this have in the future made diamonds absolutely worthless as a luxury, in fact in this time period diamonds are usually used as a casual thing, it's just everywhere and used as a building material for super structures with worlds like this being strip mined for that exact purpose- to enforce and plate massive, massive structures.  The glinnvyr take that in its stride, with gleaming diamonds all over their technology.
