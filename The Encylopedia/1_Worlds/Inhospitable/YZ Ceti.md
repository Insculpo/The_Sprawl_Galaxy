A variable flare star whose many smaller Terran worlds flayed by YZ Ceti is an ancient example of the skipping precedent, that is how many stars can be skipped over ny interstellar expansion.  The only thing of human presence even centuries later is some probes marking the worlds for potential mining some day down the line (local system resources remain plentiful and there's better red dwarves for late colonization) and a few nomads hiding amidst the comet belt who have been mostly uncontacted despite such close proximity to Sol.  In part because they just evade explorers who approach and warping to them often ends up with them already often being somewhere else.
