Bechaoyao was a fortified artificial world that held out against the [[Custodians]] heavily, a feat of industrial engineering from the Constructivist Imperium, a short lived society of [[Whandl]] origin that fought to the end against the Custodians and managed to destroy thousands of them.  The Constructivists lost over a trillion.  Many of those losses were non-combatant.  The Constructivist packs were among the [[Composer]] collaborationist fronts against Custodian exterminators using a strategy of chaotic diversion that made knowing what to strike at far harder.
