Tsonga Prime was a cloudy desert world that had never much chance to develop, as it was one of the main sites caught in the crossfire between the Regnant and the Consortium, with orbital warfare causing a Kessler catastrophe which created a debris ring.  Much of the population died in the Battle of Tsonga when the situation degraded to the point of WMD usage as the Consortium went on an annihilation sweep when the local forces proved to be mostly Regnant compromised and using MIRV swarms on sight of the Consortium.  Such chaos was part of what made the whole war have a very negative outlook towards the Consortium despite the Consortium being who would win the conflict.  Salvaging around the world would lead to a rebuilding in the 2600's where the world became a Assembly controlled world.  The surface of the world never was a place people liked being due to the rapid global sandstorm winds.  Mining guilds on the world continued their activities until the more centralized world ministry nationalized the mining faculties in the 2700's and the industries of Tsonga Prime would grow into a major part of various militia forces in the surrounding sector.  The residual trauma of the total wipe out of the old orbital population and the debris that rapidly deorbited in large asteroid-like crashes that scar parts of the world however still make the place feel haunted to those who work there.  A situation not helped by local virtual populations.
