# Object Z-vk

## Overview

An object that is so mysterious that it defies all classification.  Anything near it disassembles into polymer structures, not due to gravitational compression or some processing system.  It just does this, imploding everything into strings.  These strings are latched onto a spherical seeming structure that is really countless "spikes" of the polymers added to it.  This property is inexplicable and no one knows what is going on, it is unlikely natural but the creator is unknown as is the tech used to achieve such disturbing effect.  It's not clear the intent or purpose of the object, why it stores molecular information the way it does or if it is anything more than something that just is.
