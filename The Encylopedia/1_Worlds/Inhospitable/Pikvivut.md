Pikvivut is an oceanic world that hosted some form of civilization before the [[Phidians]] purged it.  The purged civilization was evidently a thriving aquatic civilization like that of the [Alephids](Alephid) or [Somber Hydras](somber).  But they did not have the luck to be near either of those and may have even advanced beyond those societies judging by the scale of what leftover scraps prospect space agents in the area have recovered.  The world itself has had its oceans terminally altered in PH to wipe out all complex life in the biosphere and signs of slagging from a wave of orbit-surface nuclear bombardments fill the area.   

No attempts were made by Phidian species to colonize the world after, but they actively quarantine and defend the world to this day as if they know what they did was on some level, ethically wrong.  Or at least, they are paranoid of accountability from other civilizations in the galaxy, especially the Sprawl.  It is not clear the motives, but it is known the Phidians are a civ that actively mind control and vow their populations through a wide array of means.  They may have been seen as an unwanted complication.
