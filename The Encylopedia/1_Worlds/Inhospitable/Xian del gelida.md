Xian del gelida is another world lost to the chaos of the late 2400's and 2500's, it was a world that had seen total decimation from [[Vopson]] invasion and later was the site of Tarma Vis.  It was a cold, tundric world and the vast monuments to Tarma's pride can be found preserved in the the depths.  The world once was just another colony world, but as things altered and developed it grew its own identity before the Golden Swarm attacked.  They managed to fight the golden swarm off with the forces the Domain of Kus had built up from defecting peacekeepers and local militias, but the rogue admiral Tarma Vis proved to have their own ambitions.  They sought to centralize humanity to one will on the goal of avoiding the chaos of the old vanguard as the Domain of Kus generally followed a neo-vanguardist mindset.  They attempted a crusade, but it didn't work out.
