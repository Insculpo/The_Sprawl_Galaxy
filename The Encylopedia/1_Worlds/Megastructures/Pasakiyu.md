## Overview

Pasakiyu is a powerful artificial world on the intersection of the [[Urzine Domain]] and [[Mediators]]. It is notable mainly for its tangled web work of synthetic ecologies and mingling of ikeitans with other species of [[Prospect Space]] as a quasi-diplomatic and neutral meeting point for trade.  For all the hostilities between the Ikeitan and [[Utanguis]] dominated factions, there is a shocking degree of interfactional ties between various over-packs and guild groups often meeting in the depths of the microgravity jungles of Pasakiyu.  One can be forgiven for being disturbed by the place, the local denizens are sentinels always on the watch, with strict regiments from the local vilate manages holding the artificial world in line.  

Not all can attest to the various elaborate projects done here, in a niche without earthly equivalent.  Mainly the casual modification and alteration of void ecologies to make elaborate mutagenic performances with bone-like instruments.  Such coordinated, singing ecologies are an art made and shared between the vilate and ivoltic groups who despite being associated with different factions often collaborate on pieces such as the Meandering Bladders or the Exponential Limb Cyclic.  One can watch them go procedurally for years, indeed that time is needed when negotiating out neutral dispute treaties between the competing hegemonies so diplomats enjoy the performance.
