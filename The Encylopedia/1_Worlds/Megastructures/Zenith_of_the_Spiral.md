### Overview

Zenith of the Spiral is a megastructure of Mjazzan/Custodian design that acts as their most eccentric and terrifying device by far.  And what is amazing is the pace at which they developed it all, though this structure is actually recent, only a thousand years old and is multi-purpose.  It acts as s tourist destination, being one of the few places they ever allow other beings to go as they so avidly show off, mainly due to how it is situated thirty thousand light years above the galactic plane and was built within five centuries using a thick disk population star's material.  This super structure is a super mall of sorts, along with being a weapons platform with multiple Nicoli-dyson beams they can use to sterilize worlds from incredible distances if they so desired, even if the sterilization is something long ancient.  Indeed, they may have used it on earth already and we wouldn't know for over fifty thousand years, a time span which is pretty huge given fifty thousand years ago the Galaxy was dominated by hive minds and slavers instead of by ultra advanced solipsists.
