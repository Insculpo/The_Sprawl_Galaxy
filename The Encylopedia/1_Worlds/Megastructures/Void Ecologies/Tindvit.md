Tindvit was a large Trojan cluster of asteroids turned micro worlds that the Invuka Combine did a lot of their activity.  The organisms on and around Tindvit show many traits that reflected the ideology of the combine.  They all are able to live on the many asteroids to no issue.  They are able to drift for AU at a time, little care in the world.  Giant disconnected space cities on flat disks used to be around here,  but the disks haven't properly thrusted in the past century leading to a miasma of misery for the Tindvit collectivists who tried to continue their dream of breaking to a truly universal genome.  The almost moldable skin textures lend to the unnerving combined forms of the Invukan, the pathetic attempt to mimic the far advanced sprawl's programs shines through most in how much they tried to emulate the sprawl denizens.  The shifting cargo cult tech that never worked properly.
