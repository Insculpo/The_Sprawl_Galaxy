The Foam Cluster is a [[Tikali]] phenomena in the neomush, a cluster of micro worlds built in a Trojan belt that outgas a nebulous atmospheric region of microgravity that can be more readily navigated by the Tikali of the area.  The Promoli are the most prominent Tikali group here as they continue their work on a range of microgravity hypernaut experiments.  The general community is built around a stable K-class star of young age, meaning many usable planetoids and asteroids along with the range of other curiosity the Fimass system has, like access to a lot of easily terraformed earth size worlds that the Tikali have many staked claims on even outside the foam cluster which is situation in the Trojans of a local gas giant.

[Hypernauts

Hypernauts are astronauts who can with just an advanced astronaut suit traverse vast spans of space, changing trajectory with backpack fusion powered thrusters and handling gravitational forces that would crush the organs of most.
