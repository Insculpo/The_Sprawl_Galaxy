### Overview

The Panalama complex is an extremely narrow cylinder shaped habitat only 120 meters in height, but nearly a hundred kilometers in length.  It is a complex which stores a vast share of mud and swampy, stray creatures who are well adapted to the gravity flux of their world.  Regularly you see life fly into the central low gravity hub for migration (temperature shifts are a regular feature of the world and the low gravity Folk are a picky bunch). This naturalistic complex is not of sprawl origin nor of any recent origin.  It is a very sedate place, however and it is extremely unknown who made it or why.  A fact made worse by how the very purpose of the place has been long lost to time.  Deep enough that the creatures here show clear adaptations of Darwinian, non-modified origin.
