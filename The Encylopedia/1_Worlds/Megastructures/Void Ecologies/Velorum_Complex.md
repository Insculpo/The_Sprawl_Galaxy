# Velorum Complex

## Overview

The velorum complex is a complex, vast network of plasma streams the size of a nebula that has been going for millennia on end.  It is not sure what enabled it, beyond knowing it sources its lights from bright stars that are pooled into it on strange attracting highways into fluid, geometrically and mathematically perfect shapes.  Highways of plasma interconnecting across the entire open cluster, with the very vacuum of space aflame in controlled ways.  This makes the velorum complex naturally, incredibly dangerous.  However it hasn't stopped activity from the [[Vays]] from being widespread, to the point where there's speculation that the structure is Vay in origin due to how much they are around the structure.
