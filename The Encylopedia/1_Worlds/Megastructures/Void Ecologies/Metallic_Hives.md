## Overviewï¿¼

The  [[Natvyr]] were contacted and uplifted by the [[Tikali]] in the 2400's and were mostly clients.  However in the centuries since they managed an interstellar society of their own, especially with the various internal issues the muck had going on adding up and the drowning ops arming the Natvyr.  The Metallic Hive is one of their main hive arcologies of note, which are located in an asteroid belt that interconnects with each other in a sprawling Natvyr hive that rapidly grew in populations.  The Metallic Hive has ballistic weapon users and flash printed careless rifles that are standard issue.  The Metallic hive's potential is grand and have pretty much become a massive pestilence in the Civic, with the Estates and Mush even considering an alliance to crush them as soon as coherently possible.

The metallic hive itself is a huge industrial center, and they do trade flesh and metal all the time with their biomatter generators being utilized for all matter of bizarre needs.  They're standard Natvyr fare on the whole, though they are less matriarchal than Asa's hive with drones having more power and the Mothers being stuck in a mixed system that is confusing for the workers.  Some workers even went into resistance mode despising the broken hive as they called it.  Not due to the work conditions but the questionable sense of purposes as the workers were often just managing drones and little else.  They hated managing, they liked working.  So many hated the metallic hives and that revolt has been an ongoing trouble exterminator Jikati Hukiv Vuli who pretends the hives are fine and their exports for various toys from the Mush and Assembly can continue even as production issues from subterfuge.
