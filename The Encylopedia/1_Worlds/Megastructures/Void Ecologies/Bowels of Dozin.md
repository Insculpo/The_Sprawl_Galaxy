One of the most ancient of the void ecologies, a swampy void ecology that was made with lots of Bloladian biological programming from inexperienced megascale ecologists that has created a vast aberrant void ecology filled with the hardened gluey substances the flora leak constantly, with many organisms being extinct and the Kessler syndrome of the whole experiment being one of mostly failure.  The place has some salvaging regardless, along with explores who crack into the timorous growths, looking for any potential peculiarities that may have useful applications- the [[Dozin]] Glue here is primitive compared to what later void ecologies could produce, however.
