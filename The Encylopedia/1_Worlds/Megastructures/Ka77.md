The Ka77 
 
A multigenerational metallic world the size of a dwarf planet has over the centuries been layered onto by a large population of related [[Jama]] iterations that have built the layers almost as an artistic statement on the nature of time, they seem intent on continuing their aggregation and consolidation of materials to their junk heap of a world, which in many regards has become a scrap heap of a lot of [[Metasyndicate]] garbage collected and recycled into the project over time.  They evidently are a part of an asterisk of such junk planetoids, with the intent on further consolidation until it compresses into a neutron star that will be further fed until it becomes a black hole.  Such goal is likely to take stupid amounts of time even with K-2 resources as they rely on detritus to make such a thing.  Similar such projects are known to occur in the sprawl, but it's hard to say if the intent was similar to the kind of directive these Jama follow.
