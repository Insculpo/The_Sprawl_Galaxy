The Juncture is one of the more peculiar aspects of the sprawl fossil network, primary because it was how prospect spacers found not one but two other civilizations. Humans and [[Tikali]]. Control of the Juncture is important for that reason, even if it does represent one of the lightest sprawl colonies to the point local sprawl denizens don't value it at all and didn't care much if some upstarts made use of it. The juncture is a sparsely populated neutron star system, but unlike the Cancri complex very little survived at all.

This is where things get worse. The small settlements that remain in the belts residual of programmable matter have been mainly ran by what are just known as the juncture residents. The Juncture Residents are a mostly formless entity, but they are large and orb in shape. They dodder about and seem to just die something akin to hobbies, just completely disinterested in the upstart societies that craw about the fossilized wormholes. They are regarded as basically part of the juncture's terrain more than coherent intelligences, just as the soft hum of the automata who maintain the asteroid sized bits of world that contain the 2 km throated wormholes to [[Gilizet]] (another one used to lead to the ethereal realm but it was cut off in the chaos of the rupture) and the [[Flux]], where the Tikali were discovered.
