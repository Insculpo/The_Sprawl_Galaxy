The [[Flux]] leads one to [[March]], a world that appears to have nearly been a client of the ancient community but the rupture made them but a collateral of that galactic apocalypse. The Flux itself is more elaborate, being a shell world which may have become a matrioshka world like the infamous Karbana [[Kinnis]] but never could reach that potential due to once again, the rupture. The world had a kabuzihin megahive festering about it.  One that attacked [[Tikali]] expedition vessels that strayed too near. However they have mostly been brought down by the prospect spacers, and so when armed Tikali vessels appeared in the system

To return the attack the Tikali explorers had found instead an utanguis boneship fleet led by [[Pidarti Kinnis]] types. Contact was tense as a result.

The flux world itself only appeared to have a dozen layers, which made it of great interest as it gave insight to the energy->mass tech used by the sprawl. However the hostile defenses hampered being able to actually research it. And the usati on the world are uncovering one black box spaceship away from throwing the prospect spacers out. Existence has been shaky at best at the Flux world.
