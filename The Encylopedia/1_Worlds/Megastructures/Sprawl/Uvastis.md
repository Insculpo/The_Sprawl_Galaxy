# Crush (Or Uvastis)

ï¿¼## Overview

The Crush is the site of custodian-sprawl-Prospect chaos.  As there's no proper names involved, the literal translation of the system was applied.  Or Crush.  Not sure why it is called this beyond it being a recent war zone and a sign of the sprawl's vulnerability to the higher vitality of the upstart civilizations.  As the Sprawl forces here were fighting Prospectors trying to shut down their wormhole suspecting it as a site of custodian intrusion, they didn't ultimately succeed just due to the custodians retreating too fast and the prospect wanting the wormholes for themselves to get access to the nexus.  The general modern situation is that the sprawl forces were were pacified but ongoing back and forth for the system between [[Prospect Space]] Factions has been happening for centuries, especially between the [[Urzine Domain]], [[Metasyndicate]] and [[Mediators]] who have managed usage of the gateway in the Crush system at different times.  

The current status after the Mediated War is that it's contested between the Mediators and Metasyndicate while Silent Pact ships may be attempting to slip through to fulfill their own vendettas on a very specific, very powerful distant rival.  The [[Custodians]] not destroying the wormholes as they retreated has been an ongoing contention, but those who want it destroyed usually lose out to those who point out they made their own warp gates anyways and that having the gateway gives a direct line to the greater sprawl they would lose if that gateway was destroyed.  

It is a seed core system, so it still is filled with sprawl inhabitants even if the upstarts have come to totally occupy the area and often these sprawl inhabitants are fighting defensively against attempts to dig around the more insular groups.  An overall risky activity as some Urzine who discovered one of the structures worshipped some unknown theological beings and tried to blow it up found out a century ago.  That attempt at genocide was met with a flotilla sprawl ships from a group of those worlds destroying half the occupying ships in the area and the Urzine getting pushed out by Dozinist forces in the midst of the chaos.  

Since than research has ceased with the prospect spacers being ever more focused on their occupancy and defense of the gateway they used space and lots of defenses to ward off the sprawl denizens from accessing.  Various attempts to retake by the sprawl locals have been mostly failure, but they also are on the defensive so Prospect fleets that attempt to get rid of those sprawl habitats find it too arduous an effort to bother.  The Urzine Incident only entrenching that attitude.
