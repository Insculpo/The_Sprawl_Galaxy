### Overview

The verdant reach is a ancient faculty with profoundly EarthLike life situated inside a huge rotating cylinder with animal life, it has ancient organisms from who knows when and they have grown massive in a near gravity free and energy rich environment, fed by the fusion energy of their faculty.  Its owner still runs it, deep within, a vicious being, who reigns over these jungles it has made for itself and has made all matter of sapients for it to hunt for its own game.  Wormhole access can be found from the upper district, though it is highly barricaded by the roots and trees within.  The hunter who built this faculty liked having company before the systems collapse caused a refugee crises to its realm, which it came to exploit and degenerate to the sad, primitive existence which they now live as it has barricaded itself from the outside universe.
