The Abandoned Sprawl

The Abandoned sprawl is a convoluted bit of Sprawl that can be found in the intersection of multiple other civilizations.  The Abandoned Sprawl is the site of the Timid Ones, a clade of Dioviermes who have technologically been geared to constant siege from the Laronians they have nowhere to go from.  These Timids were apparently cut off from even the fossil network because they offended the Great Nexus wormhole keepers by trying to steal conduits of wormholes and re-arrange them to their own ends.  The conflict escalated as the demand for outside help against the high amount of upstart societies in the area freaked out the Great Nexus societies that wanted nothing to do with the distant conflict.  So the cluster was just abandoned with extreme carelessness by the Great Nexus.  

The Abandoned Sprawl notably makes use of a multi-layered core world known as Kip Igna, which underneath the absurd amount of built up defenses over the millennia by the Timid Ones hosts a vast steamy volumetric artificial ecology that has been the main base of operations for the Timid Ones.
