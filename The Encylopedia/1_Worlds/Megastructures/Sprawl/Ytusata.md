No one goes here.  All access to this world of the galaxy is barred, even other sprawl worlds.  It was the last sprawl monument, a final cry into the cosmos for the preservation of the greatness of the sprawl.  One it keeps wailing, often just to kill whatever gets near with devices and weapon systems unfamiliar to those who have never gone to the sprawl such as dematerialization waves.   Don't go here, whatever you do.  And even the archivists have no access, the dematerialization waves are took much a liability.  Still the beacon-like screeches reveals the Ytusa to be a world that is just crying in hope of reconnection to its ancient past and for grand intervention.   Than it becomes to incoherent to really know what the beacon wants.
