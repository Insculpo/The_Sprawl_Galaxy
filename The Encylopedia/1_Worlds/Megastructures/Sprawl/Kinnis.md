## The Ember (Or Kinnis)

## Overview

The Ember is found in the prospect and is the most well known sprawl ecumenopolis to have survived to the present day...  barely.  It is far more developed than the sprawl world Mizar G, with the world being all city.  It was evidently a distant city world and not fully connected to the seeds, being a rogue dispatch almost.  It stands as the core of Karbana Kinnis regardless, with prospect spacer occupants in some parts even as the Opallian Domain dominates it and has been an ongoing threat to the region as a whole.  Opallian activities even were found in the Lost Cluster and are speculated to be why the Etherials collapsed their wormholes, a stupid choice but one the Opallians loved.  

The Treasure world is called as such because it's an ecumenopolis built upon a gold rich Terran planet.  It is ancient, dating back a daunting 20 thousand years with construction stopping around 12 thousand years.  Many sprawl colonies in the Karbana Kinnis Cluster come from this rather developed seed world.  It seems this world had a collapse as expected but it wasn't to the totality of many other sprawl worlds where they were reduced to slag and molten rock, gravitationally unraveled or dragged into the nearby sun.  This world was lucky.  Indeed they followed a general sentiment of luck, the survivors.  Even with the conflicting factions from the White Hive, the First to fifth Federation and last city or even the Jarto they seemed to have been an outlier of survivors.

 Nor the stragglers of [[Uvastis]] who were defeated by the scavenger civ that had arisen since.  They are a conceited bunch, more interested in conquering sprawl worlds in the cluster and potentially retaking Uvastis than in doing much about the scavengers who raid them.  It's hard to do all that much, as they work with anachronistic technology constantly and the ancient divisions within Kinnis have yet to ever resolve.  Most sprawl denizens just have no interest in such projects and many will go out of their way to subterfuge them even, not wanting to replicate the past.  They just want deterrence from the scavengers and to be left alone to their realms.  Whatever federation with their warlord puppets controls a part of Kinnis can be hard to care about as one explores the vast empty cityscapes with automata moving about reminding many of what once existed.  

 The population collapse and recovery was all due to the automata and this lead to widespread superstitions on the sprawl that have persisted for millennia since.  This world constrains populations in the trillions, yet still feels mostly empty to prospect spacers who managed to explore it (not hard, considering that the inhabitants rarely use spaceships and have various warp gates to other parts of the cluster instead).  They're connected to the verdant reach as well, their space elevators go high and humans who managed a sprawl back door still are exploring the labyrinthine of the Treasure world in its many artifacts and lost societies lurking in the endless automata supported urban sprawl.  

Karbana Kinnis as a world in all its glory has many sub-regions of note. One is the mantle accessing expanse from the time the world was in full swing production, as while starlifting was a capability the sprawl had it often was seen as pointless for an ecumenopolis project. Indeed the depths of the expanse reveal a vast cross section of underpolis regions in the vertical incline one sees drop over a hundred kilometers. Some small bridges cross the expanse but most do not, attempts to breach the deeper sprawl often have to run through the Karbana Ti expanse where one has to evade massive automata and deal with all matter of gravitational anomalies of unknown nature. Whatever exists in the depths does not truly want to be known.

**The Recursive Volumes**

One of the things one realized in exploring the sprawl is the way much of it was almost geometrically and algorithmically created, this aspect of the modern sprawl can be readily seen within the recursive volumes that reoccur from time to time. They are a trap of sorts, it is not clear if they existed before or after the ancient sprawl collapsed and dating methods prove unhelpful due to how automata keep reprogramming the matter and in the process "making new" the recursive volumes. The general trend of these volumes is that they are volumetric mazes that expand in 4-dimensional space. There is very often the change you enter such volume and become forever lost until your energy reserves give out or otherwise some violent automata cast into the volume to be rid of them by the active factions destroys you.

**The Partitioned Volumes**

The partitioned volumes are one of the special parts of the impossibly convoluted puzzle that is the sprawl and what could break a civilization so vast and seemingly without opposition. They are small hyperspatial pockets that have numbers not fully understood or known, with many of such hyperspace nodes simply having been completely lost to existence without any wormholes linking to them. How far these go is not well known or understood, however the Architects are known to have dug the deepest into them so to speak where they encountered some exceedingly inexplicable entities that could not be reasoned with on any capacity. They were believed to be the basis and inspiration for the statics, a cargo cult copy of what those entities were. The League of Wisdom also has at times struck out from a partitioned node, mainly from a hyperspatial wormhole connection to a place that happened to be strategically useful to them. The Archivers are believed to use a system akin to the partitioned node net to explain how they manage to be in the places they appear. More advanced civilizations than those within the scope in our thin film of time may manage stuff that makes these node partitions look absolutely primitive...

Karbana Kinnis is a world of many, many layers but there is a differentiation that one encounters as they descend further into the depths of Kabana Kinnis.

**Sterile surface**
10-20 km of extremely tall structures believed to once have been for commercial and residential usage, much of which is a skeletal fossil of rebuilt sprawl matter after having to build back from ancient bombardments 
**The high sprawl**
This layer is known for its vast imposing deep access wells to lower sprawl layers and being an open, spacious realm of atlas pillars and landscapes of maze-like terrain where surveyors hide to keep the sprawl continuing.  It is filled with extremely deadly substances that are residues of wmd systems meant to purge the planet's population 
**The protective layer**
A deep protective layer that is main almost in vain due to the wells, but still exists to absorb the shock of even a relativistic shell or worse a GRASER.  The insulators nature also heavily interferes with most forms of connection, despite the sprawl inhabitants having once used a vast a wormhole grid for communication that was apparently easy to shut off when an invading force was detected...
**The great brace**
The upper sprawl layers were built on "the great brace", the massive atlas pillar complex full of disintegration fog and war machinery.  It appearantly was how deep the invaders had gotten before mostly retreating.  The defenses here are much tighter than even upper layers 
**The living layers** 
The sprawl extends down through "living layers" that are also mostly empty, but it is where the remnant populations have managed to thrive once more in various empires that are terrified of the upper braces and lower heat areas.  It is believed civil wars had in the past collapsed the population, and still seem to stunt population growth even now in long struggles to reclaim and build on the ancient builders of the sprawl.  A hopeless task. 
**The fester layer** 
The festering layer is a massive recycle zone and once was a sanitation crisis where whole biospheres of decomposers and scavengers lived off the waste products of the residential layer and traded with the industrial layer.  Business is kept meager but sustained by remnant descendants of earlier festering.
**The Industrial layer**
The deep machines are a hot zone, not helped by the lack of cooling being sustained over the millennia.  It is mostly broken and non-functional on Karbana Kinnis.  But the purpose remained clear, to be refineries of nanite goo and automata not easily building by upper layers
**The alchemical layer**
The alchemical layer is the layer of Karbana Kinnis where energy->mass plants weee numerous even by sprawl standards, however they apparently didn't get too much before the collapse. They have had grey goo leaks, but the searing heat has nullified them as has the electro gamma tic atmosphere also doing so. 
**The mantle lifted**
The part of the sprawl that gets matter from the mantle and was mostly dated due to already having energy->mas cracked.  But they still wanted matter to transmute more than a a means to conjure matter from energy being congealed to matter.
**The mantle hiders**
The depths have hidden mantle bunkers like uncontrolled.  That this still fighting a war long lost.
**The Core Station**
There is a core nexus  plant, it will explain some stuff.
