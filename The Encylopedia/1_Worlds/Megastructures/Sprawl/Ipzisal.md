Ipzisal is a complicated hyperspatial sprawl that is strewed across multiple light years.  There is no real beginning or end to it.  It has no clear originator, beyond the potentiality that there are beings within it recursively hidden within the hyper spatial architectures that are superstructural filled with a widening sense of dread from the incoherent, abstract entities which come in and out of existence as they add to the whole damned thing.   The shapes of it have no real good earthly equivalent since they are fragments of experiments with hyper geometric objects, so their movements and behavior can seem vary unintuitive as is the hyperspatial navigation of the hyperspatial sprawl itself.  Indeed Ipzisal is the central web work of the broken stars, as it cuts through cosmic voids and space-time blisters regularly.  The zikelli navigators of the space call it home, as they have a better understanding of hyperspatial navigation than most.
