The Pablum of lost communities

The lost fairs of galactic society. We have seen it firsthand truly. Beings of countless worlds. Forms endless and most beautiful. All in a harmony and cooperation unimaginable even to the chaotic, and ultimately competitive culture of prospect spacers. They were more of a unified force, assimilate to the cosmic fortitudes of the ecumenical in ways we cannot really understand. What actually was going on isn't clear from the artifact behind simply the sentimental force it has. We see into it so greatly a world lost. We see abstract figures of beings we have no reference for. Implications of crowds densely packed for kilometers everywhere to these vast fair events. A world where there seemed to be a serene happiness, one we were ultimately left out of by the vagaries of our circumstance. The artifact itself is a shadow projection, the Pablum of Lost Communities is what the projected imagery is called. The simulation which it comes with is even more hard to decipher. People who entered it with the [[Gilizet]] machine acquired interfacing system found a sterile "fair" as we understand it. It was a pale realm, there seemed to be no life at all on it. All the fair's artifacts still were there.

Notable finds:

-Artifact One

Artifact One was a mixed tangle of unknown substrates that was further tangled or untangled, possibly a game of sorts they played?

-Artifact Two

Artifact Two was a noise device, it seemed to play sounds in many channels at once and even had wormhole clearance. The music it was left making could be head in sync with other devices found like it in the area, the opulence they had to use a micro wormhole for a device like this despite such feat being so easily replicated with inferior tech is hard to understand until it was realize it had additional matter transport functionality. Why this was included is beyond anyone's guess.

-Artifact Three

Artifact Three is an oracle device which visualizes stuff seen elsewhere to obscene accuracies. These are known devices used throughout their civilization, to what effect and impact on their societal life is unclear as this is not a tech anyone is close to- not even the architects.

-Artifact Four

Artifact Four was a reclusive complex with special region hyperspatial geometry in ways that seemed designed to trap you. We lost one explorer to it, which was tragic. Even if it may be as tragic as losing a caveman in a hall of mirrors. The fair's toys even, can get humans killed. This is a lesson to take into account for future explorations of simulated sprawl spaces. Disconnecting the victim was done as a mercy killing, we managed to get an uploaded mind of theirs recovered (accessing the mind with a telepresence was not possible, the Gilizet interfacer is extremely incompatible with human technology outside the niche functionality) but without a stream they were on ice for the rest of the mission and if we die, that distant backup will be a fundamentally different person.

-Artifact Five

Artifact Five is a surviving automata who couldn't be interacted with beyond its desire for us to follow it around in circles, giving a tour of the "Kada Vi" district. It was from here the insight of it being a fair-like environment was made clear, some entertainment complex setup to garner attention to the district. Why this was done isn't clear as their civilization in theory was so post scarcity a fair analog shouldn't have Interested most their populous at all. Than again, they had far greater numbers back than that even a niche fair with gadgets they called antiques may attract some audience to their district from the countless districts around it...

-Artifact Six

The Tube. Just a tube found. Entry into it was not attempted after the incident with artifact four. Someone tried to throw a tracker into it and it reappeared somewhere kilometers away outside the simulation space in the world layer right below the team's own after 27 minutes. The simulation is open doors in ways not initially anticipated, adding questions as to what the empty simulation even is meant to be purpose wise. It was initially assumed a backup simulation.

The beings appear to have been ancestral denizens, a reoccurring sight. The main realization is that we haven't actually seen a hundredth of what the sprawl actually is. These simulations are what was found reconstructed from the upper layers of one of the worlds. There is countless others just like it, this tiny slice of life however gives a sense of insight that is hard to ignore- they lived complex, dense lives. They were communities. They were social beings who had their dramas, relationships, concerns... all dead. All faded from memory. The point of this fair proved unbearably hard to discern for that reason alone. Even in the residual simulation, only one automata was there. And everything else... phantoms of data mutilated by unknown means.

Our fears became manifest

The Reactive Zones

One of the most dangerous parts of sprawl exploration is coming across a thing you have no frame of reference for- even the fair killed an explorer with a hyperspatial maze attraction due to lacking the psychology for it and their game rules cutting the comma off. Without any fail safe, which may have once been the duty of someone long dead. That was for what is understood to be just casual entertainment for them.

Reactive Zones are much less clear. All we know is when you enter one, it seems to scan you and make beings that are reactions to your thought. They can often be extremely dangerous due to being nanite fog entities, automata stationed in the area have been translated as stating one needs some protective layer before entering. Power suits it turned out, didn't cut it. The probes sent into the reactive zones were immediately destroyed. Their automata thinking was not valued by it. They could discern automata and agent thinking somehow, or worse the human made automata really did just think of wanting to be dead all the time. Either way, a human with full body power suit was sent in and they encountered their mother as some monster outs augmentation of human debriefed forms that harassed them throughout the zone, as other manifestations of their mind formed across the place. The abominations grew in distorted numbers, unable to fulfill their original purposes anymore so they slumped aimless about only trying to unify with the power suit. The power suit man even with a particle thrower found themselves overwhelmed by the forces thrown at him, to the point he just toke his own life that let these beings have their way with him. They were going to gang rape him. Even the mother. Reactive Zones are ill advised to enter without further psychological surveys. Backups were not possible to recover due to being too far in the reactive zone, which looked safe without anything to react to. But that was an illusion, one we made for ourselves. Watch out for these zones, they seem to be where we least expect them.


-The Plains of Memory

The region found in Karbana [[Kinnis]] found beyond the Ki Tun Kinnis Junxture is known as the plains of memory due to how it is full of summurforms and post-usati groups. It is a harsh place to navigate, and has made using it to cross interact with prospect spacers a challenge. Prospect Spacers arrive to us from it, usually a [[Pidarti Kinnis]] affiliated group intent on going to Gilizet for their own reasons.
