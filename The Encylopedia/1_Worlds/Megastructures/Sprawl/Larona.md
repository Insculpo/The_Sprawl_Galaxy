### Overview

Larona is a network of dyson structures which houses a world within a world which is known for being incredibly hellish, and highly geometric while filled with rapidly evolving life forms who have been here for many, many millennia who are fine tuned to the escherian environment which dominates the realm.  Laronian societies are descended from sprawl inhabitants and they have proven increasingly expansionist in recent times, though they are horribly specialized to geometric settings and find natural terrain highly unfavorable and tend to loathe it, tot he point where when colonies other worlds they won't even touch it until miles of infrastructure is built for themselves even with the compromising nature of it.  Laronians have mostly spent their time invading other parts of the sprawl through wormhole gateways they have recovered.
