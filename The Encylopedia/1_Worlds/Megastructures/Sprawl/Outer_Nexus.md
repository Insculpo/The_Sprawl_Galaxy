## The Outer Nexus

## Overview

These vast structures are derelict in nature and are all part of the grand nexus, which was found at the center of the largest sprawl cluster within the known galaxy.  Even after the collapse, many of its wormholes still work.  Sprawl clusters known to link to it include the Karbana Urvastis sprawl cluster, which is in the prospect.  The grand nexus also links directly to the Yaqu Vi Sailu sprawl cluster in the Architect and also deeper into the greater sprawl...  [[Diovierme]] activities are common here and this nexus has the League of Wisdom as the dominant force.  Other invidious former administrative forces are known to lurk amidst the vast complex.  Ikietan refugees exist in the region as do various other groups of unknown species lost to time who barely subsist on a broken complex.  Much of the modern complex is basically uninhabitable, needing protection to deal with the radiation heavy flares and various sprawl caustics of unknown nature.  Exploring the sprawl nexus is vastly dangerous due to not only the warlords and environmental hazards, but the league of wisdom's gatekeeping that even the custodians had to outmaneuver and game to get to the prospect.  While local forces are powerful, the tech is anachronistic to hell.  Shapeshifters are alongside tribes of beings using leftover flash printed particle carbines and all matter of radiation laced micro-missiles that has made the local life very radiation resistant.

Indeed the nexus is quite alive and has interstellar activity around the grand cluster, where imperial activities are most prominent.  They lack interest in the other civs, with the wormholes and [[1_Worlds/Megastructures/Sprawl/Larona|Larona]] complex being viewed as easier treading than the "void" even after the collapse.  These fears seem linked to the cargo cult drive systems utilized by the league of wisdom being not built for longer range in mind.  The numerous nexus communities here managed to continue efforts, with the sprawl automata here working to rebuild the nexus mostly even with scavengers commuting through the Nexus at their own peril.  The League often expects deals and all matter of strings, they don't play all that nice.  Meanwhile you need to be able to trek around the system and the league only cares to let you have passage,only escorting around the warp gates while everywhere else is "free space" to the league.  Meaning the various marauders and scavengers in the artificial world networks orbiting further out and near the sun have free reign upon you.  The Silent Pact's blink Drives are a huge bug bear, the league of wisdom has no idea what to do about it and fear they may break one of their wormholes.  They're not impressed by the tech, instead being unnerved by it due to reminding them of some ancient drive systems rumored to have existed in the sprawl when it was thriving...

This class of structure is evidently reoccurring, with the greater sprawl apparently having over a dozen.  But the only one in our part of the galaxy.  The procedure of the sprawl's dreamers seemingly used highly developed systems like this to spread more seeds to build additional sprawl clusters once.  The great breakdown of the procedure and the civilizations that relied upon these structures still haunt the nexus, indeed even more than many other sprawl structures.
