-The Ki Tun [[Kinnis]] Juncture

The KTK Juncture is a gateway to Karbana Kinnis from the depths of Gilizet. It is one of the surviving fossil wormholes. It is a large gateway controlled by automata and it shows, for humans were allowed to go through because there isn't some clearance needed. It was a public gateway. So public they just did enough monitoring to keep you from destroying it. This isn't the case with a large share of other surviving gateways. Denizens in the areas seem to not care humans go through the gateways, they stalk by and watch but don't seem to care much to interact with the explorers. Even in their realm, the denizens are indifferent.
