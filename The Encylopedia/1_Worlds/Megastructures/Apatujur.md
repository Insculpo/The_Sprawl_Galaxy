Apatujur is a World that historically was built by the Mediator Gestalt to archive information on the Dominion, but as the scope expanded and entities like the [[Pidarti Kinnis]] subverted it, the world came to also house [[The Sprawl]] and Cobalt artifacts. where the days never end.  It is a vast world of potentialities filled with vast ancient archives of Sprawl, Dominion, Cobalt and more riches lost to time.   The somewhat enigmatic Pidarti [[Kinnis]] has come to secure the world, but they have to deal with regular attempts to raid it regardless and it does not help there are members of their organization that collect and trade the tech with other groups.  Groups like the [[Waywardians]] who have managed a lot of collecting of artifacts themselves for reasons not clear but clear enough to the composers to cause a large shadow war around the artifact installation between multiple factions.  Apatujur as a world is a tire-like shape with wide gravity gradients that it works off of for the diverse populations of organisms which permeate the structure.  As it also does include a lot of zoo-like structures.
