The Bliss Complex is a large virtue coalition complex.  The Bliss complex is a swarm of neural tribes whose common noosphere exists mainly with 30% of the virtue coalition concentrated in what is basically the de facto capital of the [[Virtue Coalition]].  Many leave just due to the suffocating and demanding outlook, others however like the automatic defense network which has emerged in the area. The present situation is mainly the tribes keeping to their micro-worlds and protecting the bliss complex from outside ills with the angel net and equitable distribution for all as a way to appease all.  They still are part of the greater VC who find their partial isolation from the rest of the coalition a dangerous trend.

**The Klus Scandal**

The great traitor Klus attempted to singlehandedly destabilize the whole Bliss Complex, doing so out of a disgust for the enlightenment those of the bliss complex had reached.  Klus broke the lines of the neural tribes, causing too much internal knowledge to spill out.  The shock and horror of what other neural tribes had been up to led to chaotic and distorted census but eventually the census algorithms had singled out Klus as the cause for breaking the harmony and restored it by having a census against clause be carried out for disrupting the peace.  Klus went renegade, escaping into the [[Grand Assembly]] where assassins are regularly sent.  Other VC members don't give much damn about Klus but the clout of the bliss complex meant a lot of anti-Klus action was taken.  After the Klus Scandal the Bliss Complex had to spend decades trying to find better ways to bridge the gaps of the neural tribes, however hard common ground had proven to be even with the shared dreams of some hypothetical commonality being found.
