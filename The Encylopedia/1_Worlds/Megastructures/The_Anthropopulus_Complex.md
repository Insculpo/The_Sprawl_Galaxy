## The Anthropopulus Complex

## Oveviewï¿¼

The largest megastructure humans have ever built as of 2900 AD, and is still in construction (as it has been for the past three centuries).  This vast project was an undertaking by the Estates, their crown project and also the capital system.  It is an orbital ring around a brown dwarf in a binary system to a F class star.  It houses over a trillion people across a hundred thousand artificial habitats that hold self contained civilizations that are samples of prior human societies in a vast human zoo ran by the super human elite of the Estate.  

The local advanced humans who run these micro-worlds view their act as a favor to them, even as they lord over like they are dieties in controlled systems that some [[Utanguis]] agents from unnervingly comparable to the Cobalt.  The vast project was already under construction during the [[Vopson]] invasion and was not affected by it directly.  It if anything gave extra imperative to work harder on it and without the oversight of the terrans, make it the capital of what the Estates viewed as their own domain.  Terran meddling was always a bother and to them, they now had a way to progress and even annex nearby systems without worry which they did not too long after the Vopson invasions.  

  They also have been in conflict with the Assembly in many occasions, especially due to ongoing fears of the Assembly allying with Mush or Asanian Hives.  Most of all, the central world of the Estate remained mostly the focus with the other worlds being Client worlds who they often put under rather authoritarian local rule.  

The nature of the complex has been viewed as one of the greatest crimes in human history by the Assembly due to the horrifying backwardness of the people in the artificial worlds, deprived of all and reduced to neo-agrarian states while also being expected to send their children to pilot spacecraft or be forcibly integrated into a cybernetic apparatus.
