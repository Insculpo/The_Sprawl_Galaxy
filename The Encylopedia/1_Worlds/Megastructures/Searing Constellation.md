The searing constellation is a [[Virtue Coalition]] structure that consists of neural tribes who are more hawkish on the [[Grand Assembly]], part of which is due to their BCI hive constellation being in close proximity to the VC and another part is how their communal societies were infiltrated by GA species sent by a world ministry without much recourse from the higher echelons.  To them this was just a strong sign that the midnight war ended too diplomatically and is putting the VC in a disadvantage to let the more individualistic atomized humans of the GA continue being the way they are.  They believe the noise a part of a vast GA conspiracy as well and their views have been widespread enough to cause the VC to be more militarized than in the past and parts of the noise to be in mandated therapy and psychological rehabilitation should they prove too subversive in their beliefs.  However many in the VC do not want such activities going further fearing it would consume the neural tribes as well and break the diversity of thought needed for Virtue style collective wisdom to prosper.  

The authoritarian streak of the searing ones is most prominent in their communities where thought and dream privacy have been completely banned, cutting them At odds with even the Bliss Complex who are hardly ones for heterogeneity in thought diversity themselves.  Other VC tribes are even less for the searing ones but lack the census needed to take any action against their "mind arson".  Their strict, totalitarian micro worlds show extreme coordination in the shapes they take in the bright star system they are found in.
