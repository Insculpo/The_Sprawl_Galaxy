  
A Tikallian structure that exists mainly as an experiment in gravity-fluid dynamics that developed into a commercial powerhouse. It is a Tulso creation, part of the prestige seeking behavior of the modern Tulso Tikali and their desire to magnetize other species to their pod in their glory. It also exists as a part of the [[Tulso Pod]]'s attempts at competitive with the grandness of [[The Great Blue]] Great Blue computational complex,  How much a glorified water park and entertainment centers can really compete with one of the greatest technical marvels [[The Murk]] ever produced is of dubious merit. Still one finds a lot of engineering work in managing vacuum current flows that allow one to swim in streams of fluid to other micro worlds in the cluster of artificial installations that have lots of industrial and civilian usage in making better managed and inhabited artificial structures that the Tulso have found more practical uses for.
