## Corpopulus

### Overview

Th Corpopulus complex is a network of worlds Spanning across a Jovian system which houses huge populations of many sprawl entities, of whom seem to have regressed greatly from the once advanced existence their society once had.
The many habitation zones and orbital stations which occupy the moon system are traversed through transport craft and drones with cabins for the natives- it is like an automated airport with the planes coming and going at set times.  It is a deeply vagrant existence for those on ground, who have for many millennia only known this complex of the Corpopulus, and nothing else.

The way society works in these places is very complicated, for the warlordism which is everywhere in these places
