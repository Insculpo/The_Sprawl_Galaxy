## Overview

The Steel World is an artificial planet, made of many layers inwards and many biospheres and is incredibly rigid in this nature- each biosphere is almost completely cut off from each other beyond heat sinks with multiple layers sucessively hotter, steamer and pressurized as you go down handling a vast range of biospheres.  It is completely abandoned beyond mindless automatic war machines whole populate the surface and attack anyone who gets near.  It is a [[Sleeper]] structure of some sort, that much is known.  

For what purpose is unclear, as the life within is pretty much all stupid and no experiments have been done at all, though perhaps that is the point- it may well be an entropy experiment.  Or it could be conservation.  Or it is just there to exist.  It is known that the internal ecosystem is incredibly rust based, for the closed systems have had to deal with progressively less energy seeping in for the past millennia the experiment has been in motion.
