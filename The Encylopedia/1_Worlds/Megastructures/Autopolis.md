# The Autopolis

The Autopolis is known for being the incubator of long lost atrocities, held within by automated security machines who never tire and have become their own civilization dedicated to the protection of the dead.  They see not much need to deal with outsiders beyond weapons trade in exchange for raw resources.  They won't trade any of the ancient artifacts for any amount of wealth.  It is impossible as a move for them to do so by their own internal protocols.
