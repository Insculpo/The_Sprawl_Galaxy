# Rasuf's Point

## Overview

Rasuf's Point is one of the largest [[Rasufian Legion]] complexes of artificial worlds.  Rasuf's Point is a series of artificial worlds in orbit of an A-class Star and is a site of mass testing of all matter of military tech distributed to other parts of prospect space.  It is a powerful political center for the silver legion as well since pack masters regularly visit it and at times even turn their guns on each other to the enthusiasm of the forge alchemists.  

Rasuf made the place initially as a site of peace after the Custodian invasions to establish a lasting stability that really just united the packs under a stronger, more capable leader who the battle thralls fell in line for.  Indeed the battle thralls of other species have long been a powerful asset of the legion's pack masters as fanatical loyalists seeker a better life through civil service to bolster the forces of Silverite pack masters.  

The integrationist of Silverites is a source of pride, within the pack representation and democratization of power among those part of the vast all-packs of the Silverites.  Their meddle is often tested at places like Rasuf's point in vast simulated spaces and large strategic games.  Rasuf's Point is viewed as a place of the highest prestige for such combativeness, the Oxford of boot camps, gaming arenas and the testing of fancy new military technologies.  

One with "liberal" ethics would be concerned of the placement of military testing faculties being so near the pack games and other tourist attractions, but for silverites the testing of fancy gimmicky weapons the forgers are up to next is part of the appeal of the place.  Training, gaming and testing all in the same star system.  For those becoming kin of the silverite packs, there isn't a better place.
