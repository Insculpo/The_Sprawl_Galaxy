# The Shimmering Light

One of the largest [[Glinnvyr]] Structures known, the Shimmering Light is a multitude of interpersonal world states harvesting energy around a red giant.  The red giant is what supplies them and what enables their continued existence, even as they have a paranoid culture of mutually assured annihilation.  This sort of tense environment and advanced military technology makes this star feared, especially when they carry out unpredictable raids to outside places with no real rhyme or reason beyond some sort of ritualistic need to do so.
