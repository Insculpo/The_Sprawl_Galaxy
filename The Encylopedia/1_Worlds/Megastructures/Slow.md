### Overview

The Slow is a vast complex which was made many, many millennia ago.  It is in a time warp which slows the perception of time for the societies within, Making the universe around them pass by much faster than they can preview it.  These complexes exist in their own little, highly advanced world which acts as a resting place for its makers who seek to view the end of the universe first hand.  

To guard their complex, a specialized group of beings known as the custodians have come to being.  They are made of those who seek redemption for their errors through acting as loyal guardians to the Slow.  Only those who are deemed redeemable are allowed to be part of this, for others are viewed as simply too irredeemable to be allowed custodian work and instead are sent to the deepest layers of their matryoshka worlds.
 
The structures within are ancient in architecture, their layered constructs viewable from space with another layer of orbital rings at various latitudes of a dim, dim red dwarf calculated to be able to survive for trillions of years, which this complex in particular has made the rallying point for their kind.  This structures are very much living, the natives still are fine and alive, their society is functioning well and healthy, only issue is they function in a distorted existence due to putting the universe on fast forward from their perspective.

In fact, it is a whole cluster of red dwarves they have made, which many such interlinked structures.  This anomalous structure had proven very hard for astronomers to detect due to the overall dimness, and how it is still under construction with new red dwarves and black holes being transported using STL methods to this day.  It is one duty of the custodians to handle the automata and operations of these megastructures.  
Another is to do galactic photo taking, mainly to get data on the galaxy and check on any potential developments of intelligent life and snuff them out.  It is a complex made of many thousands of red dwarves as is, meticulously crafted in its gravitational architecture in a format very reminiscent of a globular cluster.  It is thousands of light years away from us of course.

The vast shares of living space are incalculable to the human mind, simply the distances involved in reaching if are immense- 37 thousand light years from earth.  
 
The great failure of the custodians would become clear as they went rogue.  The loyalty for some, never existed to begin with.  Some exploited the very system simply to get out of what they have long come to see as a torturous existence under their 'sleeping' masters.  Yet even they wouldn't dare disturb them- no one dare wake them up, no telling what they may do should they break out of their blissful existence.

This complex holds many secrets still, with not a single answer to spare.  The custodians will destroy on sight anyone who even so much comes within a thousand light years of the complex and there is a obsessive range of defenses against dyson beams, kill ships and any other potential dangers to the slow.  

Those who get too close get numerous warning transmissions, mainly in the form of a deafening blare and the sounds of ships getting destroyed being projected in many, meant frequencies based on their knowledge of the tech other aliens have.
