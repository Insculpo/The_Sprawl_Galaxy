# Plasma forms

## Overview

One of the more exotic forms of life, though exotic only by the standards of matter for these plasma forms are amazingly common- anywhere a powerful mantle exists, they do as well.  They are a evolutionary fluttering of sorts, caused by the vast hyper pressurized state to which the cores of large worlds are accustomed to and while usually not that prevalent, in exceptional cases they are able to completely flood a star causing life span anomalies and such due to their excrement being literally iron.  They float about reproducing and occupy different niches at different layers of their host star and even some have attempted to travel outside their star to virtually no success, they are pretty much unknown to the rest of the universe unless you can somehow survive being in a star and see them without disrupting their media in a way which kills them.  So earlier advanced civs overlook them completely even if they suspect their existence.
