Viracocha is a steppe world found in the Assembly as a very earth like, if somewhat arid world.  The world's orbit is rather harsh regardless, as the axial tilt is 77 degrees which leads to harsh variations of the seasons but nothing impossible to manage.  It wasn't a world with complex life, the 1.2 Billion years wouldn't allow for it but such youth meant volcanic soils and a low ethics harm biosphere for the colonists from the 2300's who first introduced Terran life to the world.  Centuries later the place is one that has seen many changes hanged, be it the control of the Vanguard to the contested control the Eridani and Consortium once had on the world and the Assembly's current activities.  It is also a Silent Pact recruitment hot spot, mainly since the traffic of the word makes it a decent spot to recruit and life vicariously for the Silent Pact.  The vast expanses of lifeless desert change over the years.  The dry, burning brushes, the ancient mountainsides and such  have made for a great place for manufacturing, refining and building cybernetics and hardware.  It also is a hotspot for augmented fire resistant agrarian goods, the Virachochan Roots are a genetically modified food that can be planted effectively in hot environments.  There is also a lot of lithium lying about.  A lot of orbital infrastructure is around including an orbital ring known as the Viracocha belt filled with chandler cities.
