### Overview

The Night is am ocean world that froze over after it was ejected from its parent star from a nearby passing red dwarf.  It is an ocean that goes over 40 km deep in regions (with some places just a mere 5 km deep due to asteroid impacts and whatnot), iced over in a thick crust and kept alive by geothermal activity.  It is a world that has millions of years left for its biosphere, in that time the life used to hydrothermal vents and solar energy from above has managed to adapt to a far poorer existence, living within hotspot regions and migrating between desolate, freezing oceans to find where activity is.  And in these pocket ecologies, with pitch black life and massive cellular organisms, a vast range of pressure adapted organisms thrive without light.  Just hugging the rocky regions still around, even as the ice slowly creeps in its elevation and even as the heat slowly goes away- which it won't for another hundred million years due to the sheer size of the world.

**Ikirmite Contact**

There was a secret attempt to colonize The Night World at the turn of the 2600's.  The Ikirmites were independent and seeking colonies of their own even under the reality of human dominion in the sectors around them.  [[The Manifold]]'s explorers took renewed interest in human astronomical data as worlds humans had mostly left as cursory interest spots such as snowball worlds which while were of scientific interest never were seriously considered for colony worlds over worlds more akin to what humans preferred.  

However, the Ikirmites had interest in all matter of worlds suited to the niches and environments they prefer and "The Night Ocean" was of particular interest.  The [[Ikirmite]] explorers did not properly prepare, they worried more of human interception than of what the local confirmed biosphere may hold.  The probes they sent down were limited and didn't appear to show anything too hostile for an Ikirmite.  The Ikirmites figured megafauna could exist, it existed to some extent on their homeworld and they were megafauna themselves.  But they didn't anticipate the sheer degree of scale the local organisms would reach.  Some were kilometers in length.  Colonial sure, but still.  Things which competed with spaceships in size- stuff usually associated with jovian floater biospheres.  

But that didn't dissuade the colony attempts.  The secret manifold colony mission had technology and used it to secure control of vent zone hotspots.  The disruption to a biosphere doomed to one day freeze over still was significant.  The colonists had to bunker down and actually make defenses beyond anything ever needed in the much, much more developed oceans of Ikirma.  The Ikirmite colonists found themselves behaving more like organisms terrified of monsters than the apex predators they were used to being on such worlds.  Terrified, bunkered up and needing to navigate the rules of a world more alien in its rules than first anticipated.  

One of the major faulty assumptions, one also made by humans, was that the superficial similarities of a biosphere meant similar colonization methods worked.  The Night World proved that to be in error for the Ikirmites.  Cold seep nomads were impossible in the Night, the ice crept deeper than with [[Ikirma]].  There was also the swarms of hive connected megacellular organisms that harassed the Ikirmites regularly (as if the abyss leviathans weren't already nightmares to contend with).  The colony was seemingly doomed to fail and uproar from conservationists over the illegal colonization of a biosphere made colonization of The Night World a bombastic scandal that had even Ikirmites questioning the competence of the Manifold's affinity.  

The colonists proved incredibly stubborn, hunkering down and hiding their activities in response to scrutiny from other interested parties.  While it was known their vessel was going to the world, the intent of it being a colony was not discerned.  It was regarded as a scientific effort and humans with affiliations to the Manifold also gave credence to that, as there was actual scientific research done but the colony being one able to grow with incubating ikimites on the mission being a detail left out.

The colony ultimately did manage to stabilize, but they failed to grow much due to not only the pressure from outside the world but also the difficulties of The Night World as a whole.  A planetary colony was never going to be born from the venture without direct support and assistance that they were never going to get beyond tepid trade from less scrupulous actors as the colony has become more or less a black market outlet with lots of hidden secrets and asylum seekers by 2740 AD.
