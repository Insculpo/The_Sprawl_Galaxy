## Ikarlothru

### Overview

Ikarlothru is a 'heavy water' biosphere.  By that, one means it is a biosphere where the radioactivity of the world is strong enough that the local biosphere has organisms used to having much more radioactive water than the mean pumping through their bodies.  In orbit of a red dwarf is one of many worlds in perpetual twilight, this one known for its twisted spine-like forests and flux of water which these strange root flora process, not absorbing the water but instead transporting it upwards around around while relying on radiation absorption from the periodic super flares.  This irradiated water ends up being used as a ecosystem for much of the life on this world, which the low gravity again permits even if the weak air pressure means that floating is no option- simply controlled falling from high distances. 

That being said the seas see these roots everywhere, which completely and utterly dominate the world in a huge, mindless biosphere network.  This phenomena is known as the Ikarlothu and its origin is unknown as to whether or not it is truly organic in nature.

### Fractal Tree Grabbers

The FTG are creatures with fractal limbs they use to help navigate the web worked trees of the Ikarlothru, they're extremely arboreal and can break falls using atavistic wings.  They go about the trees hunting for preys arching them with fast shooting hands that grab them.  They're around the size of Jaguars. 
Tree Suckers

### Tree Suckers

These Tree Suckers are clam-like critters that latch to trees for parasitic reasons, have a smaller polyp form that roams for a nice spot to start sucking and they than entrench themselves.  They reproduce with spores that become cysts at lower levels, which hatch into crawlers who find new places to suck sap from.  They're stationary, and suck slowly, lasting a several months before running out of water to filter from a dry season.  They populate various biomes of the Ikarlothru like herpes.
