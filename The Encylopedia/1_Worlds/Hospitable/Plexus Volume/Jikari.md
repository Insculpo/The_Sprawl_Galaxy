## Jikari

## Overview

Jikari is an exotic super earth that was flung out of its parent system.  It had managed by luck to capture a new moon on the way out and retains a large helium atmosphere that has insulated the depths of the world from the frigidity of space and background radiation.  

Jikari has migrated around the galaxy for millions of years just fine.  Life on Jikari is weirdly vibrant, with fluorescence and a glowing cyan complexion from unknown sources.  Life here is used to very cold environments, with the lower layers being rich in nitrogen and oxygen.  The Jikarian ecology centers on the need for geological energy that is attained from the still warm core primarily.  

Still the slow paced nature of the life here is the norm and it is from worlds like this that are the norm where various ices and an increasingly cooling environment over millions of years has led to very energy efficient organisms with cyrophilliac traits.
