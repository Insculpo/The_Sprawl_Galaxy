## New Atlantis

New Atlantis is an inner colony world that makes use of biotech heavily in the post Vopson world, but again, they have no lead and are more a de facto [[Grand Assembly]] client that also is an Manifold Client.  The dichotomy can be confusing on the whole.  The world they colonized was a watery one, with aquatic cities and cloud cities being common due to the low amount of land area to utilize.  The world also supports a local biosphere which shall now be tangentially described below.  New Atlantis as a culture is an oligarchy with various utopia experiments in the mountains, post scarcity arcologies and augmentation freely experimented with.  They weren't like this in the past, where they were a more conventional colony that was under the Terran thumb.  However, the Vopson invasion completely broke that as the Vopson slaughtered a third of their population as the terrans left them to neglect and was too busy attacking the very peacekeeping forces they had help from.  

That they exist now is from their own ships and tangential peacekeeper help at best with nearby colonies not being able to help due to also fighting [[Vopson]] swarms.  They held out for a decade of this, to which saw their oceanic world acidified as the various orbital colonies were blown up and Kessler syndrome was intentionally induced.  The Vopson invaders on the surface took their usual sadistic pleasures of massacring the populations, making meat heaps from them and drenching crowds of people in super acids just to watch them burn.  Yet that sadistic mindedness slowed down their ability to kill off them, as resisting forces underwater and in other parts of the same star system regrouped and struck back multiple times over the decade.  Still billions of people were dead and the Vopson flocks still were around, even if scattered from the swarm as a whole and as isolated flocks that in modern times have shifted in their flock minds to stuff much more peaceful.  At the very least keeping to themselves around the local gas giant moons.  

Still, the survivors found salvation in various biotech innovations they used to clean up the planet itself to the degree they could.  The mass extinction Vopson acidification caused and undoing its damage proved a higher priority than rebuilding their own wrecked infrastructure and led over the centuries to a world where biotech permeated everything.  The local Vopson flocks still are a bother to the system and there's local factions wary the growing [[Ikirmite]] influence.  Not to mention they have been caught making deals with Prospect Spacer entities in the past several decades.  A local system war also broke out a century ago between New Atlantis and other groups in the system that have more space based infrastructure who tried to limit access wreckage around 2635, making more wreckage and remains an ongoing sore point.

## Ecology

New Atlantis supports a biosphere of Planimals which populate the shallow oceanscapes and navigate the tidal complexities of the two moons.  The thicker air density of New Atlantis near the surface allows for "surface swimming" that has also made lower regions of the world toxic to human settlers.  The mountains are where primarily human colonies were developed, as that is the land with easily breathable air.  Being both photosynthetic and heterotrophs has made things very complex on this world as more purely autotrophic larvae sometimes "overgrow" in one of the phyla creating vast networks of aquatic flora that put the once Great Barrier Reef to absolute shame.  

Other wonders include floating islands that are actually living creatures which act as a biome in of themselves.  With those living on their backs and undersides that create large clusters seasonally and a land ecology of almost entirely shelled organisms.  A phyla with endoshells as part of their skeletal structure that interacts heavily with the surface swimmers in lowland regions.  [[Human]] activities have been mostly in upper layers outside the arcologies and the lucrative biotech research on this world, one of the 5 closest worlds to earth with complex life.    

The world suffered a major extinction from Vopson acidification and the engineered bacteria that had to be cleaned up even centuries after the disaster, but megafauna species such as the islands have in recent decades recovered in numbers and many surviving species who had specimens taken other planets have since been reintroduced to the world.
