### Overview

Oxides is an oxygen rich archipelago world diverse in life used to high, high oxygen content and adapted to the control of fire.  This control of fire enables them to have very, very peculiar properties.

### Fire Streamers

Fire streamers are from the oxygen rich world loosely named Oxides due to it being the first biosphere like it.  Fire streamers fly around the skies trailing waves of fire as an exhaust and defense system they also can breathe fire to cook prey for better consumption.  Fire streamers can "hover" thanks to their air bladders.  Fire breathers are remarkably short-lived creatures, growing as polyps from trees and living only a couple weeks in their mature form before dying from exhaustion, a issue never addressed as they usually breed as soon as possible once adults.

### Fire fish

Aquatic creatures with both an endo and exoskeleton, having a armored body with soft limbs that retract into the main body when not moving.  Fire fish can generate waves of heat underwater as a mechanism to kill prey or stun predators, burning them.

### Huffers

Huffers are from high oxygen worlds and are incredibly fast flying creatures that snatch and drag small prey, and can never stop.  They eat, breed and die mid-air and are highly explosive.  Huddersfield undergo a metamorphosis before becoming the short lived adults, in which they grow upwards and "launch" from their polyp.  The eggs have legs, as buffers technically give live birth with purses to deal with impact.
