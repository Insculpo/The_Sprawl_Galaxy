### Overview

Sammanus is an ice giant that had been flung out of its main star millions of years ago, causing life on Sammanus to migrate to lower parts of the gas giant, progressively adapting to heavier pressures to the point where they can stride helium seas.  The violet coloration is not normal- much of that is the product of bacteria who process the potassium and manganese rich peculiarities of Sammanus to create the chemical soup which Sammani life live.  The purple color of Sammanus is usually missed due to the black color of the planet from it being in the interstellar void.  Sammanus life is accustomed to extremely pressurized environments and they explode if they migrate upwards- some mega fauna are known to explode with the force of nuclear weapons (an event the natives view as Sublimating).  The low level life gets heat directly from the core and mantle and higher level life subsides off that energy.  Sammanus is the homeworld of the [[Gripperite]] species.

An anomalous event associated with Sammanus and the Gripperites is the presence of a sammani colony in the [[Ice_Emperor]] system, of which logically should have been impossible due to the Gripperites being primitive and the conditions of the jovians being impossible to reconcile.
