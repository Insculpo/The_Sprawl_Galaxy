## Overview

Ikirma is a subglacial world.  It has a 12 km deep ocean, in total abyss covered by 4 kilometers of ice.  The atmosphere has condensed into ice for the most part, sustained with a thin veneer from periodic plumes.  Ikirma is orbited by two small moons.  It is much like the night, being among the snowball worlds lost to interstellar space.  It is an analog to the night in many regards- massive subglacial fauna, bioluminescent beings abound, a reliance on hotspot regions and so on.  The critical difference in this world is the pressure gradient.  Ikirma is not as massive, the gravity well is weaker being comparable to Venus or [[Earth]] than the frozen super earth that is the [[Night]].  This means deep parts aren't as pressurized, allowing for all matter of vertical movement and flows with the convection current systems.  Ikirma is the homeworld of the [[Ikirmite]] species.
