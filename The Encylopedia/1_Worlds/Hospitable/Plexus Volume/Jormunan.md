## Jormunan

## Overviewï¿¼

Jormunan is a [[Grand Assembly]] client world that rose to some level of importance around 2690 AD when it became a formal Grand Assembly Client (instead of the independent world in a dubious protectorate arrangement with the Estate, but that's besides the point) and major tourist destination.  For despite Jormunan being a very arid world that had marginal lithographic life at best, the artistic ventures and projects on Jormunan are vast and the clay filled desert with large plains and graphite outcroppings to many was like a blank canvas that the locals kept drawing on in earlier epochs.  

As most live in orbit anyways, these activities went unhindered until illustrations filled almost the entire planet.  More elaborate art projects started to be taken up due to the tourism revenue it generated and what once was meant to be a world to be mined for resources became a massive center of the arts in the Assembly.  With various media industries dominating affairs in the orbital cylinders and all matter of productions, sports and other industries being prominent on Jormunan as well.

It is from this world the notorious art critic Josip Kavagnaw comes from, whose 60 year reign of terror on Jormunan has been both a delight and cause of suffering for others.
