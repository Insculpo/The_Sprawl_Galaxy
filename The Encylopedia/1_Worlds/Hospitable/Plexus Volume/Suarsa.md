## Overview

Suarsa is a rather simple world, it's an ocean world with very shallow waters and a very murky, flora thick ocean.  An ocean which thrives from the shield volcanoes that exist on multiple parts of the world that are huge biodiversity hot spots.  The low depths were a product of various geological forces that got the world to be very smooth, with a fair atmosphere that brings calm, cyclic weather.  Suarsa is a calm place, on the whole.  It is notable for having molluscoids, of whom are symbionts whose "heads" are really a separate bonded organism that acts codependently of the pentapus.  They seem to fill some role in mating attraction for the pentapus, while the pentapus just feeds.  There's not much to them, they are grazers in the thick pin stack forests that cover vast amounts of the world.  Swaying softly in the currents of a world where things have been slow and smooth for millions of years.  The other creature seen is more clever, a serpentine critter that feels on smaller prey and follows around the pentapus who often disturb hiding spots of their prey.
