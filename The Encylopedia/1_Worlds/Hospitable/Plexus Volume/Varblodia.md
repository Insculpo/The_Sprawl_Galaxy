### Overview

Varblodia is a world in close orbit of a very dim, but incredibly radioactive red dwarf flare star where energetic radiation rich storms has made an otherwise earth like world in terms of physical properties into an environment where radiation bathed biometallic life forms are the norm.  Much of this is from a world which started out in a less radioactive environment- amazingly enough.  They plate the ground in a near jet black color, indebted by pink veins of resources which aggregated colonies of these biometallists have developed over the eons and some of these structures coalesce into the prominent curved structures seen in the picture.  The blue coloration is from a need to expel radiation in a perpetual vomiting of sunshine.  The world is a full-on biosphere of such biometallic life.

### Hexarosa
Â 
This six legged creatures for instance. Have no mouth, but do have highly absorbent feet they use to feed off the ground and walk around to graze.  The Hexarosa are what they are known as and they are amazingly related to the outcropping, why, they are in many cases a larval state for said massive outcroppings.
