Qualma is a world where organic mechanisms for the production of plastic-like substances have become the basis for an elaborate ecosystem of corpses and remains that take far longer to decay than anything on earth.  The plastoid skeletons of organisms here have reef-like implications for the bulk of the world, indeed they created elaborate and lopsided terrain structures known as the tubelands where various parts of the terrain get held up and entrenched by the plastic structures embedded in them.  Corrosive effects cause these to decay over time and reveal the "skeleton".  Such geography is seen only regionally, as other parts of qualma are basically toxic wastes where plastic eating microbes came to dominate and make life unbearable for anything there as their very skeleton risks getting eaten away should they be infected.  Qualma is also the homeworld of the [[Parda]], a species of scavengers who made their home in the confusing and warped landscapes of Qualma who ever since contact have mostly kept to themselves.
