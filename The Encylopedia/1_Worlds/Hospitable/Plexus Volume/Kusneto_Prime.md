## Overview

One of the main surviving inner colony worlds which has developed a megalopolis supporting a surface population in the hundred billions, space elevators and and orbital ring with hundreds of cylinder worlds as artificial satellites.  Kusneto is a highly developed world that exists separate from the Virtue Coalition or the [[Grand Assembly]], instead being a self declared system state.  They're a society that can be viewed in a niche comparable to Singapore and Switzerland combined in how they're an important trade system due to their influence over the hyades star cluster and have avoided taking sides in any outside "space shit" that they view with antipathy and derision Internally but act friendly and cosmopolitan to visitors with a diplomacy that exists to keep them at arm's length.  

They're a part of a greater solar association, a network of worlds that manages to exist as a significant minor power which has played off all the major Plexus players including [[The Manifold]], the Grand Assembly, the Virtue Coalition, Sol and even the Silent Pact.  They're rather wealthy and view themselves as a neutral zone.  It was among the early colony worlds of the Vanguard (being a world colonized in 2207) and shares a similar status to New Alantica, another association world.  

However Kusneto Prime is a much more culturally conservative world, being a culture of collected folk who have managed a rather stable system of AI bureaucracy after the golden swarm raids and the interloper incident made them deeply wary of alien forces as a whole.  Kusneto Prime didn't getting much harm mainly due to the luck of not being in the path of them, but still had to deal with the inconveniences the whole ordeal caused as a secondary consequence along with fending off both [[Vopson]], various "peacekeepers" and privateers who were widespread during the warring factions period as a whole.  

During the warring factions period, they did fall to one individual.  A powerful BCI hive entity known as Tarma Vis.  Of which was seen as the future at the time, leading to a century of being a rather totalitarian society as Tarma Vis tried to expand the power of Kusneto Prime to other systems and most notoriously, believed they could invade Sol itself.  The failed Invasion and Seige of Sol had consequences for Sol's relations with the colonies that lasted to the present day.  Tarma Vis was overthrown and the BCI network was disconnected, but many BCI hives still exist in various parts of Kusneto Prime.  The totalitarianism of the post-Vis regime government ended only in 2625 AD, when those in power saw the changing trends in humanity towards the Plexus and they wanted to be part of it instead of everyone being subjugated to the will of Tarma Vis.  

As a result, top-down redemocratization occurred and led to their current culture with other intervening events making Tarma Vis and his role just a fun quirk of history to those in the 2700's.  One which despite the neo-Terran aestheticism really only ossified around 2700, long after the Vanguard fell.  Still those of Kusneto Prime preserved a lot of culture even with the totalitarian period.  

In the 2700's, Kusento Prime is more a republic with an Aster-AI bureaucracy and human leaders not too unlike a lot of Grand Assembly worlds, but they don't allow mind uploading (despite having uploaded minds everywhere) and have turned reactionary about most augmentation.   How much of it is in reaction to the failures of Tarma Vis is not clear. The automata used is very much a thing they take pride in, but even in the 2700's the automated bureacracy still expects work and labor among their human populations due to the crisis of purpose they endured in the wake of the Plexus Neutrality Pact.  [[The Vanguard]] was much less urbanized, as while Kusneto Prime is an earth sized planet with the same gravity and surface oceans, it still had atmospheric problems that only were fully addressed by the 2700's.  Older paraterraforming settlements still are used in the "rustic" parts of the world, even if they are no longer practical.
