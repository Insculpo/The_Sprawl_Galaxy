<h2 align="center">Tabby World
</h2>

### Overview

Tabby world is a cool, earthlike world where the grass is teal and the temperatures tend to range from temperate to freezing and orbits over 2.5 AU from its blazing hot F class star, in fact the world is already melting.  It is a complex world where you can expect all matter of strange critters waltzing about who are used to colder conditions than you ever see on [[Earth]].  Tabby World is called such because it was found in orbit of Tabby’s star, while a disappointment due to the lack of any real megastructure, the unexpected discovery of a biosphere here sparked the imagination regardless given the young age of the parent star.

### Ice spikers

Predatory creatures found on in the colder regions of Tabbyland, these critters have feet adapted to walking across feeling cold ice and all matter of adaptations for fishing, holding themselves against blizzards and climbing up steep surfaces as de facto tripods.  They also defend themselves from larger predators through all matter of poisonous chilla.

### Gelids

The gelid as are a cloud organism, having pheromone trails all over to direct their colonies about the place.  They're slow moving and are encased in a hardened membrane, moving through a series of tiny feet at the bottom.   Gelids move in large groups and can hop, using their spiky heads as a tool to get foodstuff.  Gelids tend to dwell in warm water a lot, following streams for mold to absorb and detritus to consume.  They exist in the coldest parts of Tabby world and must deal with Ice Spiker predation in the springs they prefer.  They are in a separate kingdom from the Spikers.
