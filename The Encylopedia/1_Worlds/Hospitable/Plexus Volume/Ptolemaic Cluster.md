[CANON DISPUTE]

The Ptolemaic cluster is a region of occupied space that prospect spacers considered to make to force access to the civic in reaction to the MIP’s attempt to lock multiple powerful prospect space factions out of human space. It is a cosmopolitan center, but one where the tensions are boiling. Occupation of the Hypatia Central Complex for one, has had an ongoing resistance just known as the Hypatian Independence Front that the composer [[Ikka]] wants to have happen, to show the superiority of harmony. Any other occupying alien empire would’ve crushed them, but here they let these humans have their fantasy of resistance. A resistance that they know can be gimped as needed, but is allowed to exist to keep the prospect space members at the place on edge.
