# The necropolis hub

![Dead Computer World](/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/Photo_Directory/Necropolis.JPG "Dead Computer World")

The ecumenical necropolis one of the largest Plexus Volume worlds known, a cool ocean world that became the site of a rapidly expanding realm of uplifted minds.

With the artificial mountainlike structures using geothermal energy from the hotspots and the oceans around them as coolant.  Of which can cause the water around them to get steamy during computationally intensive times.  This is a phantom world in many regards, highly cryptic to those who are not virtualized minds of higher degrees of clearance.  It is not clear what goes on in the depths of centuries old ancient people.  However much it is joked to be a massive retirement home, much more politically important activities are known to happen here.  Such as the convening of virtual minds on various matters in the Assembly and Civic at large, the ongoing discussions as to how to advance the post-Terran order and the Assembly's interests with respect to the rivals at large.  It is a highly protected and secured world, many layers of security exist both physically and virtually.  As a result, many prisons for virtual minds are known to be hosted here where they are kept in mental stasis or reorientation simulations.  

## World Minister Alarin Kip

The automata on the world act under the authority of local monitoring apparatus answer directly to the world minister Alarin Kip.  Alarin's identity is fluid as is, but has been responsible for the dominion of this world as the greatest centralizing hub for virtual minds in the entire Civic.  To the point Alarin Kip is someone given deep suspicion by rival Assembly factions based in worlds such as [[New Atlantis]] or the Burrows, with rumors of split loyalties to the Silent Pact filling the interstellar fugue.  Yet the operation Alarin had achieved for the necropolis here has made it one of the greatest centers of power in all of Civic Space for the virtual minds which permeate around the Assembly and beyond.
