### Overview

Soto 4 is a low gravity world without much in the way of large bodies of water and has an anomalously thick atmosphere for a world of its gravity along with managing a biosphere way too advanced for the kind of world it is- having a whole class of creatures whose main body is a “seed” for fractal limbs.

### Votols

These scale filled  critters are found on the low gravity world of Soto 4 and their primary nature is that of a pack grazer, using their legs to maneuver around shallow brine reefs where their food is.  Large groups of them tend to be the norm.  Votols have no eyes, instead they make use of spatial smellscapes and odors to maneuver their environment using their three bulbs which protrude from their head.
