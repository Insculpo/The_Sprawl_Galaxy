## Bezen

### Overview

Benzen is an oxygen rich Terran world where floating balls of puff exist- indeed the hole was wondering how long until the  with tongues.  Benzen life can float due to a stable, optimal air pressure for floaters.  The plant life is transparent, as is most life.  The Benzen world is also host to fermentation bacteria and yeast-like mold forests with branch-like spore colonies to take advantage of fiery winds (which tend to have transparency).

The life here has organisms where jet propulsion-like features exist as flying mega fauna and creatures who have been compared to dragons.  Life here has not developed sapience, but large eusocial organisms permeate the northern continent who while not much smarter than ants still have a civilization-like influence on the world.

### Fermenters

These are the Fermenters, the dominant life form of Benzen and are also an example of Benzen megafauna, a drone of that aforementioned hive mind. They dig for the tubers of fermentation trees and tend to be the size of elephants (and come in huge numbers).  Fermenters don't have much cultural depth beyond crude lines they etch into the grounds or their tendency to create artificial fluid substances of no real practical use known- they are hyper inert substances if anything.  Fermenters hives cover across the northern continent (the Fermenting Continent) of the world, but their reach is limited by the large oceanic expanses.
