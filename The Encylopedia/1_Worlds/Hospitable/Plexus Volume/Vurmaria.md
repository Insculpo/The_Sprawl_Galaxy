## Overview
￼
Vurmaria is a weird place.  And one of the more dissident worlds out there.  It is a world where the Rasuu, primitives shipped over from [[Prospect Space]] by mostly unknown means.  It is a strange situation, the cooperation of humans and Rasuu is peculiar needless to say.  The mutual cooperation has led to a colony where they interlace with each other in very bunkered up community networks on a higher gravity world.  The periodic heat not helping.  They were once part of the Assembly but in 2826 seceded due to demands they stop working with the Rasuu.  The secession had led them to less effective tech, but this may be hard to believe.  The decades since their secession has led to them regressing technologically in many ways, with them bunkering up believing the Assembly intends to invade.

### Arc plants

Arc Plants are a very EarthLike specimen of plants notable for their gill-like leaves and their unique alternating root scheme which allows them to dig up hillsides much like vines, though with shocking stability.  These weave in and out of the earth much like runners do on Earth, but unlike earth they have some lithotropic properties and thrive off calcium.

They show clearly animal-like properties despite their slow movement, mainly in how they actively sense the world around them and expand in directions along with retract, with shocking speeds at times as well.  They move their core seed around whenever it is in danger and this property is seen in the many sub-breeds, including those which are cultivated by the Rasuu.

### The Svallik
 
Svalliks are higher order organisms who have entrenched themselves in the mountains of Tartuffe and are grazers who thrive on the arc plants.  Their appendages make them very arboreal creatures, using the arc plant webs as their media of movement as they live off it and look for mates- which is the primary reason why they move, as they are quite solitary and large creatures who are mostly hunted for their streamers which are used primarily as a mating signal and stimulator.   They have four eyes which are vaguely connected to their streamers.
