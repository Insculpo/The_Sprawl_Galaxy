Or as it came to be known by the Burmese captain who overrode the older pre-Vanguard names for the planet (the Vanguard’s bureaucracy wanted worlds named by the “pioneers” at the time and so cast aside a lot of the names NASA’s planet naming contests handed them. This caused a minor controversy on Earth when the grandson of someone from that contest fought to keep the name their grandfather gave the planet- Gandalf- intact. However the Burmese captain would get the final say on naming the world Thurien).
