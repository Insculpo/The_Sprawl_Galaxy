</h2>

### Overview

Sapli is an icy world much like Europa, located in not too far from Earth.  It is a rather advanced icy world due to being the size of Mars and having a moon system which has enabled advanced geothermal activity on it.  Sapli's environment is very smooth and reflective on the surface, with few scarps and lacking even the endless tangle of irradiated salts associated with worlds like Europa.  The world is near purely white, nauseatingly so for those observing it.

### Conglomerates

Conglomerates are Megacellular life forms adapted to the pressurized depths of subglacial seas, they are made of just a few dozen cells usually as each cell is as big as a chicken egg.    They connect to make a hydra-like critter able to swim independent of water flows to hunt for smaller cellular critters with a system of entrapping and distributive digestion so that all cells benefit from any catch.  They are basically akin to siphonophores if they were aggregates of amoebas.  It is a recurrent archetype of life, even if here each individual cell specialized in a way akin to an appendage or body/head or tail fin.  Such aggregates took on a diverse range of forms over the eons, even as niche differentiates emerged with the conglomerations such as the hydraforms or the pisciforms.  At times a cancriform even appears. 

Less analogous organisms have been observed, such as the use of the large megacells to create buoyancy structures akin to a small organic submersible able to handle many gradients of pressure with a single cell that specializes into an air bladder.  Some even split/merge contigently into tensor structures with cilla weaving the megacellular organisms in a way akin to a wireframe with ameobic vertices.
