### Overview

Diagones is an otherwise earthlike world where oceans of urea producing bacteria dominate and stain much of the landscape and atmosphere by creating an ammonium dense environment.

### Planetary System

Diagnose orbits an F-Class Star that has already hit the sub giant phase.  Diagones has a small 300 km moon that orbits rather far out and as a result, has small tides.  The world itself has a gravity well comparable to earth, with slightly less gravity.  Diagones has a 57 degree axial tilt, leading to some very weird seasonal cycles caused by significant regions of the world having seasonal days.  Diagones rotates every 21 hours for each day.

### Geology

Diagones has a vast wealth of urea forming volcanic fields that over the oceans have created oceans of urea filled waters.  The stains of urea and urea based minerals of the world are widespread.  Rocks that resemble kidney stones are everywhere.  These kidney rocks are the product of evaporation due to a geological process over the past twenty million years that has seen this world become more desertified.  The continental plates on diagones are not much different from our own world, but there is the notable existence of two large oceanic plate lines and oceanic ridges towards the southern tropics of the world.  The asymmetry in fault-line activity is a product of the axial tilt and the crust getting thinner in the southern region of the world.  

### Ecology

The world's urea rich hydrosphere has led to very chitin filled life where bony, rocky skin is widespread.  The bacterial mats of diagones has given the world its lurid green-yellow atmosphere and seas, with Uric acid being everywhere.  The life here has all matter of peculiarities in regard to the swarms which inhabit it.  One example is how their migration goes across the longitude as opposed to the latitude, circling around instead of crossing back and forth.  Such migrations are common on worlds with warmer arctic regions.
