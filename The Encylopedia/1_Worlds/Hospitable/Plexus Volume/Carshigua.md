## Carshigua

## Overview

Carshigua is a super earth with a thick atmosphere that orbits far away from its parent star to avoid runaway greenhouse effects.  However it does not avoid having an ocean of liquid carbon dioxide in its depths.  The carbon richness of the world has allowed for a foamy, soupy liquid carbon to permeate across the surface and within this soupy substance a volumetric world exists.  It is unlike an ocean in that life here instead of swim, seemingly walks in the air trudging through a mostly transparent (if at times cloudy) substance instead of trying to swim through it.  Carshiguans are able to still make use of currents and convection on some level, but they need to push around substances in a way that is almost like a soft form of digging.  Making dense pockets of liquid carbon in clusters is common on the world as a way of building some form of shelter by the local life, creating complexes of foamy and soapy reefs with a strong downward bias filled with tubular plastic organisms that connect it all.  Some of the ambush predators intentionally decrease density above themselves to drag prey down to them, using sound waves to compress carbon regionally to trap prey.  

Prey likewise use similar methods to make temporary ease of movement tunnels in front of them.  This has led to a biosphere with directed sound systems being part of the evolutionary arms race along with feathery limbs and vibrations.  Different layers put different emphasis until one gets to the boiling hot highly pressurized hell region.  Life may have emerged from that region when the world was cooler and the liquid carbon layer was more dense.  The higher gravity of the world has meant that these layers are not that thick so lateral movement matters, to the point canyons and mountain regions (which do exist) can deviate biomes considerably from region to region.  Temperature ranges seasonally vary too, with warmer seasons being less dense and colder seasons making the liquid carbon dioxide more dense.   

Of which makes the soapy, foamy seas host a range of life that is very impressive overall.  Land life is rare as there's not much land, but there's large flat flying organisms that can be found in groups predating from above gliding off the fumes of the liquid carbon dioxide to feeding areas.
