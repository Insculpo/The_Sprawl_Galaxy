The Mamajek system was colonized in the fervor of the second expansion wave, with the vanguard prioritizing the youngest stars for long term benefits and the many freed up resources. Mamajek therefore had a running start, with multiple colony ships sent to the system and the local Mamajek authority being intent on heavy industries and to a degree, tourism which limited how much the local super Saturn's rings were actually mined. The asteroid incidents were frequent in that ring system as is. The retrograde motion of the rings didn't help. Other efforts were in other parts of the dust belt, with mining industries building up rapidly and a rapid expanding population emerging from all the phosphorus they uncovered in the system. This rapid growing population would be what the blue one's auto enforcement systems had to handle, as one of the systems where those systems were actually somewhat welcomed despite their heavy handed aspects. The collapse of the vanguard led to a lot of chaos breaking out in the system regardless as mega corporate entities emerged, it was one of the worlds under contested control of the Consortium and Regnant whose mega corporations had taken over a lot of industries in the system which led to riots and a resurgence of class conflict not seen in centuries. 

The darkness of the dim age was upon them, a decline to 21st century living standards seen across the system as many of the protections the vanguard had was lost. The dependency on autoenforcers left the system vulnerable to privateering groups and other technobarbarian raids who would ravage the super Saturn itself in 2538 in the Massacre of Mamajek. One of the most despondent episodes of the dim age, even if there was larger scale atrocities from the golden swarm, the megalomania of Tarma Vis and the consortium-regnant war the haunting imagery of the super Saturn's rings being bent out of shape became a symbol of the Mamajek romantic for centuries to come. The reason they did it was due to the refusal to accept a tribute relationship and a falling out of negotiations between the factions. The massacre of Mamajek became a rallying cry, one where the machine masters and maidens went into a century long guerrila war (of which including the regard-consortium war where they played the factions off) only ended with the Grand Assembly in 2641 establishing a client membership where the Mamajek system world be part of the assembly alliance. And with dread over the Virtue Coalition, it was something the leaders of the resistance forces agreed to and so a new era had begun. Or so it seemed. The radical thinking of the Mamajek system made it a hot bed for groups like the Engineer's Guild who would be a hot bed in the system, along with the militia recruits who had a long period of experience in interplanetary conflict and logistics to call upon. Tensions with the other Grand Assembly worlds was common, including stuff as goofy as the [[Gamma Caeli]] - Mamajek rivalry. There was also how the local system governors were themselves a federal entity at best, so a lot of castor AIs would spawn in the system.

The creation of the Hacien Complex became a symbol of reconstruction, it was notable for how it was a very egalitarian minded effort where the machine masters/maidens and engineer guild were in a cooperative agreement to build such a vast complex. Over the last 120 years the orbital ring became known for the many communities it hosted, with artificial and synthetic mechanisms to rebuild the massacred ring carried out to some polarizing degrees- some had seen the scars as a critical reminder of history but others sought to heal. The ethics arguments over how the whole mamajek system originated in a ravenous exploitative desire from a dead expansionist empire that was overthrown had the more radical elements win out, mining operations in the system would be mostly hatred in favor of cyclic production and an obsession with cultivation. They began to terraform the burning world of the inner system and this deindustrialization put them in conflict with the engineering union, of which only got worse with the Midnight War that fractured the ties of many groups in the Grand Assembly over the UAP's actions and how the engineering guild backed them up. 

The local system's federal authority had in 2700 been overthrown by the militias in concert with the machine unions and a unitary authority of AGI was established where the militias became arms of said Castor-class AGI. This put the system in conflict with the Grand Assembly's council who were less than comfortable with that scale of AGI rule, if only due to how unilaterally it occurred and the coup that established it. The AGI known as The Core Hacien however managed to cool the situation in the 2730's by getting its supporters to agree to a favorable arrangement where they would train and supply more militia members to the broader assembly. Some were wary of this idea but mostly went with it to preempt a potential intervention. The Grand Assembly council didn't care much for the federal reps, even if others feared that Mamajek was getting "too VC adjacent".
