### Overview

Uvami is a large ocean world laden in life that is used to sulfuric acid filled oceans (with the orange haze being normal for them).  The nitric acid is the product of the bacteria on the world and it has limited life development due to the use of sulfur to breathe instead of oxygen.  Uvami life is diverse, with flying megafauna and sea mega fauna- all of which due to less oxygen move slowly compared to life on oxygen rich worlds.  Uvami life's limits are reduced by the depths having volcanic vents being regional, between vast gulfs of pressurized ice seas that often only are traversed through the flying megafauna.  Uvami life is incredibly violent, their whole biosphere is built on cannibalism more or less, endless cannibalism.  They don't have a wide range of species per say for their DNA is variable, so very often you see what amounts to intra-species cannibalism way more than usual.
