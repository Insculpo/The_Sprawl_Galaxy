### Overview

The Varpossos are a highly tropical environment in orbit of a yellow dwarf which has highly aquatic oceans, indeed the world is 98% ocean.  It is a world considerably bigger than earth as well, with helium in the upper atmosphere and a thick crust and deep ocean.  The Varpossos has high gravity, along with weak geological activity.  Life developed here not that fast, though even with a weak geology and land masses which only amount in total to around the size of South America an array of life forms has appeared that has taken advantage of this highly aquatic, high gravity environment.  Thriving on the coasts are scale-like spreaders which are radiation resistant and highly silvery in color, giving Varpossos are silvery look from afar.  The higher than average silver content of Varpossos has affected the way life developed here as life on this world makes very liberal use of silver. This silvery property gave life on the Varpossos an incredible degree of heat conductivity which allows them to heat bore into the softer caves of the few landmasses of Varpossos has.  The oceans are filled with silver skeletons and silvery corals with rich, green pods interlaced in overlapping twirling patterns.  It is a world which is pretty, but ultimately just one of millions in the cosmic fugue.  The adaptability of life is hardly stretched here, as if this world was an effortless conquest for Darwin even despite a highly radioactive surface, a silver rich environment and crushing gravity.  Nothing that the persistence of evolution could not handle.

### Imagi

Imagi are transparent cave predators with four limbs, a frilled back and the ability to emit tons of goo, shooting it to paralyze prey and using its head fangs to suck the innards out.  They are very mobile, always finding new places to engage an ambush and use their weapons as a means of slowing potential predators down as well.  They bash their head to crack into harder shells.
