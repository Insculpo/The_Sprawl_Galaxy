### Overview

Infrared Peaks is a world with a slow rotating tidally locked biosphere which has made the life here far, far less sedentary and prone to long hibernations in order to stay within the goldilocks of twilight.  The hazy, red skies give the world its namesake as does the use of infrared vision by its inhabitants.

### Stalks

The dominant flora found on infrared peaks and many worlds like it are mobile twilight organisms known as stalks.  The stalks are planimals that make up part of a massive slowly moving forest that tries to keep in the perpetual twilight of the world, mainly due to the need to keep safe.  They evolved from more animal-like creatures before moving to becoming photovores colored red and purple mainly to get more sunlight.
