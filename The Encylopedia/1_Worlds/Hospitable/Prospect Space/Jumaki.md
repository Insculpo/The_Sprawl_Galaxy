# Jumaki

## Jumaki

Jumaki is a major [[Urzine Domain]] world with with a significant population of Yalilu as part of it.  They're notable for being a successful case of rapid arcology colonization even if the later structuring phases of colonizing Jumaki had led to stagnation overall.  They are seen somewhat with deep suspicion by other parts of the Domain due to rumors of religious cults being fostered there by the local [[Ikeitans]].  However until the Dream Agents confirm it, no action by the Urzine fleet will been taken.  And ideally that is never, as that usually and near inevitably means an orbital bombardment.  

**The Noppa Arcologies**

The Noppa Arcologies are a hotbed of strange and dissident activities, with lots of matyrs and tensions destabilizing what otherwise would have been a stable and peaceful island of middling existence in the greater overall Domain.  They are disproportionally Yalilu in population, with other species not being much accommodated for at all.  Visitors get looked upon with suspicion, even the dream agents have struggled to breach the social networks of the Noppa arcologies looking for embedded religious actors who are suspected of being harbored in various recesses of the arcology's marrow.  Other groups of suspicious activity, mainly parasite farmers and spies from the Mediator Gestalt already have been found in the marrow but this has done little to assuage the concerns of the [[Ikeitans]] who loom in their circling orbital cycles controlling traffic from and too Jumaki.
