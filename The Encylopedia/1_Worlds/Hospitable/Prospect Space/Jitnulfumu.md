# Jitnulfumu

## Overview

Jitnulfumu is a mining world in the intersection of the Silver Legion and Mediator Gestalt where the bilethought festered about.  It is an extremely cancerous planet, with lots of cancerous regions and Bilethought chapters in orbit.  It is all matter of horrid since they export cancer constantly from Jitnulfumu.  

Other groups from the Silver Legion mine biominerals from Jitnulfumu on a regular basis and the Bilethought go with it to avoid the mediators sending the purifiers in to purge the world.  It is a highly populous place, with lots of protectorate look holes to allow the Bilethought on this world to continue manufacturing cancer they spread out.  

Many others will intercept these exports, mainly those waiting just outside the protectorate to shoot export crafts down in a way that acts as a de facto quarantine.  On planet, the packs of [[Utanguis]] and various other species cities just live life like usual but with all matter of sanitation services shooting down and fighting off all matter of cancer monsters the highways are built over and the arcologies are built on.  Many of the folk on the world are biotech researchers, cancer cure makers secretly working on the world, Bilethought cults trying to improve the cancer, biomineral miners who extract the synthesized biominerals that are a byproduct of the cancer and so forth.  

That life here is in constant siege from the cancer is just seen as the way things are and in general one born here is rather cynical, even if they hope to profit from cancer biominerals enough to get the hell off the planet.
