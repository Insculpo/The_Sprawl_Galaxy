# Blolados

## Overview

### Historical

Blolados is the homeworld of the [[Utanguis]].  It is in modern times a lost world of the Cobalt, the site of which all of [[Prospect Space]] was born from that first Prospector Probe making landfall and being enamored with the place.  Blolados as a world is rough at many parts, but the lush river beds and seasonal lands had created an environment for symbiotic relationships to go to extremes not often seem.  Megafauna combining with other megafauna for mutual benefit, being so intense on this world who clades are built around the combined groups of species as separate entities.  Such separate forms deal with a world of similar gravity to earth, but a bit thicker an atmosphere with higher oxygen content than on [[Earth]].  For all these on paper earthlike conditions, the seasonal cycles are what breaks it. The world is in a binary star system that has the notorious long cycle.  All of which led to the factors that progressively developed even intelligence in the form of the Utanguis, whose ancient societies were preserved by the dominion despite the cobalt almost overwriting it all.  

### Current

The Cobalt's paving over of Blolados is of immerse tragedy, as their pet Utanguis and various Blolados organisms were kept in caged utopias by the prospectors for centuries.  Much of the world is a smoldering mess in modern times from the Cobaltine Collapse.  The smoldering ruins show some signs of recovery, but the various lost AIs of the Cobalt roaming aimlessly, in perpetual guilt of the destruction their society wrought in ancient times make it still a dangerous place to go.  Archivers, gene collectors and archeologists still braved it, as the data from the most ancient prospect space world that can be seen as the start of the prospect is extremely lucrative to this day.  The annihilation at times crystallizing the left over information, in all the trauma it had left the Utanguis who desperately worked to hold on to their pre-uplifting identity. 

**The Frost Light**

The name of the central star of the "Gyfulmus System" can be also seen as the freezing light, as the ancient utanguis believed for warped reasons the sun was what made the world cold due to how warm evenings tended to be and how cold the mornings are.   In truth, and perhaps ironically Gyfulmus was a G9 star in human classifications and therefore actually on the brighter end of the stellar spectra- even if Fosskemians (F8) and Humans (G2) both came from brighter stars while the [[Tikali]] long step orbited a K5 class in a distant binary with a M class.  

Gysipu-> Star (would be shifted to red dwarves)

Gysapa -> Bright Star

Ancient Blolados

Before contacts, Blolados as a world was a place of windswept plains and sea stacks, with bright nights from the icy moon causing lower temperature variation than in our world.  The world was at the caps frigid, icy wastes while the equator was the prime hotspot of life with mountainous volcanos being where the jungles preferred to be as these volcanos managed to keep warm even during the interglacial periods.  This led to a world of steppes, tundras and oasis of Vulcanic jungles and swampy regions from the receding ices along with some stuff not really found (often) on present day earth like storm lands in some of the more persistent wind areas caused by the world's lack of axial tilt and the more reflective albedo of the moon can lead to.  

This mean a world which looked like this;

The oceans are somewhat different than our own, but the overall logic remains the same despite ice cover meaning the world has less ocean cover mainly due to the could temperature.  The glacial cycles over the eras led to a concentration of land towards the equatorial areas, leading to a banded equatorial geography very alien from anything earth's geology has.  This "squeezed topology" leads to a lot of bluffs, highlands and mountains where sprawling plains, tundras and such are the norm.  

But to know more biological work and geological cosmic history is needed

|Epochs||
|Formation (4.5 Gya)|World was formed|
|Deep past|Life first appeared|
|Frozen Eons|The world was frozen on the surface and was a snowball world for most of its history, with a slush-like equatorial region and the hot thermal zones to this day having more advanced thermal vent life than what we see on earth, to the point surface forms of it emerged.  So this is very alien flora, like if tube worms adapted to surface conditions.|
|The Pulse Extinction|A nearby passing neutron star irradiated the world, which killed 87% of all life and would have killed more if it wasn't for the snowball conditions.|
|The Great Thaw|Increased volcanism on the world led to carbon build up and oxygenation feedbacks which thawed the world over time, it was around this time complex life first appeared 740 million years ago|
|The Disintegrated Epoch|A large asteroid mass extinction at 455 million years ago, a lot of life in this time from the stressed as frozen years started to be set on the slow trajectory towards the symbiosis based biosphere on Blolados|
|The Hive Epoch|The height of large colonial eusocial organisms on Blolados in the form of the enigmatic Y beings who were more mountain and cave oriented creatures who may have even been near sapients.  Their collapse and mass extinction was total but fossil cave networks from their 107 million year ancient caves still filled mountains.  It is believed changes in oxygen context made their forms unsustainable.|
|The Synthesis Epoch|The epoch that led to the development of the Utanguis, notable for increasing specialization of organisms as symbiotic gestalts became the dominant forms of life on the world.|
|Slinvusian Epoch|The Utanguis arose and they altered a lot of the world in the process, started at first as head organisms merged to body organisms of many species, but the Awas with its blubbery hump and the addition of the Lokas led to the Cyrs strain creating a being known as the Slinvus, or Utanguis, that came to dominate the biosphere as a sapient entity.  This would be when ancient Utanguin history occurred.|
|Prospector Contact|The Utanguis would be contacted by an advanced machine civ of beings who had done an exodus from their home world, or so it is understood.  They would integrate the Utanguis to a caretaker arrangement that became the first Era of Prospect Space|
|Post-Prospect|Blolados would after the Cobalt Shattering become a rather desolate place, but one where a lot of information in the wideswept wastes and frigid tundras would preserve lost worlds in the ice.  The Dominion had made it a monument to the Cobalt's evils, a place of mourning.  Post post dominion refugee groups would hide in the wastes of a world that looked already dead from hostile invaders and modern prospect spacers don't hold the taboos of the past so the world had been opened up with lots of information and archeology being done around some of the left over AI systems the locals who came to claim parts of the world knew well.|

Notable Ancient Sites on Blolados

**The Struggle Road**

One of the most iconic aspects of ancient Utanguis society, one so iconic forms of it have been replicated and made more arduous across more worlds with influence from ancient utanguis norms.  It is a road network that spans much the world that goes by design through the harshest climates.  The storm lands, the crippling peaks, the rolling wastes, the dark swamps.  So iconic it is, that when utanguis refugees found it again, they walked it once more.  It is not sure if it is connected to [[Dozinism]] at all, it just is a part of their collective mythology and it just keeps reappearing.  Other road networks usually avoid the struggle road, as the struggle world exists to struggle.  It does not exist for commerce or military logistics, but there are legends and stories of those who used it for just that.  The Struggle Road is harsh, it is filled with intentional traps, tribulations and whatever the interconnected ancient societies over the millennia had layered and added to it.  It is at times a detour, at times not.  Either way the purpose is one of struggle, pain and persistence.  It tests persistence and tenacity, it tests the endless struggle of existence itself, pitting artificiality and nature.  Future struggle roads would similarly advance and adapt to whatever advancements would be made by future societies.  Indeed, the Cobalt lacked the struggle roads, but all prospect space eras since have seen them built in many, many places, adjusted to the local struggles of many, many worlds and of the many, many forms of life manifested by the cosmos.

-**The Mountain of Melding**

A massive pyramid-like structure found at the center of the storm lands, at the eye of the storm where things are calm.  The struggle and labor to build it is not known, but its scale and purpose likely has changed over the eras with clear signs of layers built on top of each other with elaborate patterns and apparently different competing nomadic empires who would settle and defend the area, the storm lands being a massive barrier to invaders.  Local groups with very culturally distinct beliefs also existed, all of which showing again the weird interconnections that the 20 millennia of history over time formed.  It is not sure what Dozin may actually have been but the Dominion proclaimed the structure to be Dozin's core and in their reconstructing of "traditional utanguis society" saw the pyramid with reverence as it still stood even after the shattering.  The shattering destroyed the caretaker civilization but the pyramid still stood- bombed out and baked, with high radiation levels and melted, stripped away parts all over but still it stood.  The archives in the depths had been a challenge even with the advanced tools of trade future archeologists have at hand, the radiation melded metals fusing some of the deep archival chambers hermetically shut. Why there information stores were here was not clear, but it is claimed that these archives were where the name of Dozin came from.

**The Blacklands**

A common argument that happens is on the question of if the Utanguis could have been independently space faring.  There is no surefire truths on this, as there was a lack of rare earth minerals on Blolados but they had clear usage of gunpowder weaponry and explosives along with systems of complex information.  The blacklands put further evidence that despite the nomadic, shepherding heavy lifestyle punctured by megalithic structures, large trade centers did once exist.  The remnants of one of them is in the Blacklands, which was at the pulse of the world and was one of the elements destroyed by petty a vengeful caretaker in the shattering, indeed Blolados really had a lot of stuff in orbit that was destroyed, some of which rained down on Blolados since causing the world to frost over from the ash.  The Blacklands show signs they were not small settlements, and had even grown post-uplift to large size.  The Shattering reduced the records the Cobalt had held massively, but some names and info that may be from the Blacklands city come to mind.   They were controlled by local pack coalitions, with the dominant pack able to nominate leaders but had to have the other packs confirm it.  Again not much sign of an actual [[Dozin]] entity as pervasive as the Dominion from their own attempts at ideologically motivated archeology at Blolados.  

**The Mirrors**

The Complexities and density of societies on Blolados before contact and what may have been killed off in the shattering, mass forced movement from Blolados and more is not sure.  One of the idiosyncratic things that just break Dominion conception of the lost universal society has been the enigmatic mirror cave complexes that fill multiple mountains.  It has no reference anywhere, just this place where some builders melted glass and mirrors in what may or may not be some prehistoric Y cave.  The timeline dates it to over seven thousand years back and it was built over a thousand years.  It is extremely nauseous to even try to navigate and residue bioluminescent algae colonies needed to build in the caves had festered about some regions, making the caves filled with just a sense of living light that has again no known use.  It may have been some belief system that was lost to the teeth of time, as no ancient texts even knew what to even make of it.  A struggle road was built into parts of the complex.

**The Apahin Shale**

The Apahin Shale with its fossils proved to be a rich archive of extinct Blolados species.
