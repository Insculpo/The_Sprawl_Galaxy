# Akyamas

## Overview
Akyamas is the name given to a large complex of orbital cities and moon colonies around a jovian world with a mixture of habitable moons for the species of the [[Metasyndicate]].  One of the moons is ammonia rich, another is sulfur rich, snd another moon has a gravity well that works well with the [[Fosskemian]].  Atop of this, the central jovian world is easy enough to set up synthetic ecologies in.  Indeed Akyamas was colonized way back during the times of the Dominion and was a major hotspot for void ecologies.  In earlier times Akyamas was a massive refugee center during the centuries of violence and the Custodian Invasion.  This would allow Akyamas to flower with the rise of the Composers whose role in breaking the spine of the custodian invasion was viewed as pivotal enough to a lot that the inhabitants of Akyamas were quick to become part of the metasyndicate in its formative years.  

Since than Akyamas has seen some more conflicts, be it from the Waywardian insurrections or the [[Ikeitans]] trying to raze the lightning altars the sarkic had set up.  Overall the federated systems of the Akyamas and their [[Jama]] city machines who cater to a wide range of species and playing the local composers off each other for personal gains have been masters of meta mstability, with ritual warfare between the various moons and artificial worlds of Akyamas being well coordinated.  The system has some elements of agentism, but does not forgo social units to the extremes of [[Glisyimar]].  

Akyamas is often seen as the capital city of the metasyndicate or at least its main economic center being the site of large credit management super computers and propaganda mills.  Life is harsh here but most live well day to day, still the sense everything of value can come and go like Waves has pervaded the mindset Akyamas inhabitants due to the recent collective trauma of the [[Urzine Domain]]'s raids on Akyamas ruining many lives.
