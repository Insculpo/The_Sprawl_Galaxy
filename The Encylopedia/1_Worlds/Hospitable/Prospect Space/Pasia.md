# Pasia

## Overview

Pasia is a heavy ammonia rich biosphere with a rather arid geography.  The weaker atmosphere is a product of the world being somewhat on the warmer side of ammonia worlds.  Life on this world has to deal with electric storms as a result, as the weaker atmosphere allowed electromagnetic storms from the magnetosphere to regularly surge in the world.  

Pasia's aurora borealis are exceptionally bright and deadly, for those not local.  For those local they're great, a massive energy flow a lot of the local flora and fauna take advantage of to energize themselves periodically with organic versions of batteries to hibernate with.  The various biomes of the world however, have allowed for some exceptional biodiversity to emerge from the energyvorous organisms and the heterotrophic organisms trying to rip flesh batteries out of their prey animals.  They usually let them survive such muggings, so they may grow more such flesh batteries.  Hell, that is what the "agriculture" the sapient [[Pasis]] themselves had in multiple parts of the world when the Dominion made contact with the world and rapidly subdued it as a part of their empire.  

It was almost a victim of the custodian invasion, but managed to skirt out of danger by mass evacuations from Pasis who were terrified of their world being destroyed and believed ditching it en masse would preserve it.  They were kinda correct, their world wasn't targeted due to abandonment, but now the Pasis have become a massive diaspora species within Prospect Space and returning has been hard due to [[Sarkic]] colonists also being there as a source of tension to this day.
