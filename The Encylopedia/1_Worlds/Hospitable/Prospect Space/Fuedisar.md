## Fuedisar

### Overview

Fuedisar is a large, acidic world where the [[Vopson]] originate.  Fuedisar has multiple inland oceans connected by large rivers and is pock marked in a terrain with huge deserts separated by seas of sulfuric acid.  There is not much metal on Fuedisar, but it is possible to start fires on Fuedisar and that is all you really need to make an advanced civilization, making use of the plastic-like bones of creatures in ways impossible with calcium based bones on [[Earth]].  Fuedisar’s acidic environment has led to life which has resorted to much more rigorous, acid proof materials for protection (as the acidity of Fuedisar is more a product of acid excreting bacteria, so life on Fuedisar didn’t start out adapted to seas of sulfuric acid).

### Geology

The landscapes are generally hilly with the brazen exception of the crystal mountains that occupy the northern parts of the world.  For acidic worlds in the geological processes have a tendency to leave behind vast swathes of crystals, massive ones.

Half of the world is basically a desert that spans over 45% of the world with much, much less life than the region of Fuedisar where the massive acidic ocean dominates.  Massive regions of the world are volcanic and colorful with a rainbow of acid loving microorganisms shaping Fuedisar's geology.  Life is forged in the flow of the world’s winds, filled with reproductive gametes.  Flying creatures are common on this world due to the balmy air currents and a dry, but high pressure atmosphere where it rains sulfuric acid.  The skies are cloudy, but one who flies around mountains still will see the stars at night, even if they are obscured in the lowlands by the smoggy clouds of Fuediser.

### Ecology

Fuediser is a very bio diverse world and the acidity of the ocean is partially due to creatures of the planet as much as it is due to the volcanism caused by Fuediser being in a binary planet system.  The binary world is a lifeless desert, which has been colonized by life from Fuediser multiple times only to die out.

The life on Fuediser would find our water bleach-like, preferring instead fuming seas of sulfuric acid.  The complex life is greatly adapted to such incredibly corrosive solvent, with colorful, plastic-like trees spreading through cyclic melting.  The dark grounds meanwhile regularly build up vast quantities of lichen.  Life on Fuedisar is highly vibrant with numerous shades of purple, red & yellow all over. From above, it looks not too unlike what you would see on Io, except with oceans lined in red and the cooler areas saturated in violet in a fashion akin to a heatmap.  For the plant life on this world is very liberal with changing colors to whatever the temperature is.
Life on this world gets amazingly huge, with thick endoskeletal structures which the Vopson have managed to adapt to a subsistute for metallurgy when they aren’t simply living off the flesh.  For these massive flyers, the Vopson treat in a parasite-like fashion. Fuedisar life is very suited to worlds like itself.  However, worlds rich in sulfuric acid are quite rare much to the frustration of the Vopson.  Fuedisar life amazingly enough can survive in an earth-like environment with just a hot suit for hours on end.  The inverse could not be said for us.
