# Sul Vopal

## Overview and Geology

There is a world dominated by archipelagos and island chains, where storms of fire surge and floating islands of flesh lazily drift in an atmosphere optimal for flying and floating, to which so much life in this burning, oceanic world have taken great advantage of.

Such world seems to chaotic for a technological civilization at face value, but you see, worlds are huge places and for every fire storm filled hell there are islands of stability to which societies can take root.  Even in those fire storm filled hells have some ounce of hope from the bountiful seas and sea stacks.  

Sul Vopal is an extremely mountainous and stormy world.  Massive hurricanes are frequent on this planet and the large aquatic cover of Sul Vopal allows the world to keep a cozy 14 degrees Celsius at a distance nearly 2 AU from its parent star.  Sul Vopal is a complicated world overall.  It has an atmosphere similar in theory to our own, but in practice is complicated by the fact the world is smaller, so the atmosphere of the world is denser than our own world's.  

This atmospheric density doesn't preclude the use of fire, for the atmosphere has 32% oxygen unlike our world's 21.6% oxygen.  This means massive firestorms spread by the massive hurricanes is a frequent threat, but they are nothing to fear if you are native since a little fire isn't bad for the health of the flora and the fauna is used to it, in fact there are clades of fauna who have adapted to thrive off it.  And the wealth of water has made it easy to hide from for beings who have not.

Sul Vopal is around the age of [[Earth]].  Complex life only occurred 437 million years ago, instead of 600 million like on Earth due to ice cover for most of this world's history.  This world would still be frozen over if it wasn't for the fact that it has tidal stress from Tyn Vupal, one of the two moons of Sul Vopal, and a good magnetosphere combined with a strong greenhouse effect.  This world has aspects in common with Europa in its ancient history, with hydrothermal vents heating the world's oceans internally for billions of years and sustaining the early forms of life when the world wasn't frozen over.  This wet world has a diverse range of resources, though metal scarcities would prove a bugbear to technological societies who became highly reliant on scavenging ruins and strip mining the two moons to sustain themselves.

## Ecology

Unlike our world, there is no equivalent to the plant kingdom.  Instead there are complex sessile animals and Barioforms, which are seemingly mindless beings that have no commonality with the animoidal kingdom as they rely on sunlight, fire and electricity to live.  They have some ground life forms as well, but they are like jellyfish in behavior more than plants.  These Barioforms have led to some impressive megafauna around Sul Vopal in the skies.  Their corpses do make great feasts for life on the ground as well.

Animal life on Sul Vopal is a lot like animals on Earth, being heterotrophs as well. One major difference, however, is that they almost universally get oxygen through their skin instead of through anything like a nose.  They can afford this difference because of the higher amount of oxygen in Sul Vopal's atmosphere makes oxygen attainment much easier.  This different system of breathing doesn’t preclude a nose equivalent, but said nose equivalent is used far more for handling air bladders than lungs which are also a common feature of life on Sul Vopal.

Vopallian animals take both sessile and more animated forms like our animals do, however the sessile forms have been able to colonize both land and sea with little competition.  Balloonforms occupy the air more than the land or sea beyond their periodic egg drops.

Balloonform-like entities are generally common in worlds with lower gravity and denser atmospheres, although higher gravity worlds with steamy/extremely dense, smog-like atmospheres also work for such floaty creatures as well.  Balloon life on Sul Vopal are very common, bordering on obliquitous with beaders, blimpers and skywheels being all over the place.  

Sessile animals make up a large share of life on the many landmasses of Sul Vopal in the absence of plants.  One major change from plant life is that sessile animals are
much more animated than plants, with some of these sessiles being larval in nature and others being the adult form.  Still they enjoy a phase in life where they are mobile unlike plants on Earth.  

Fosskemians had to rely on a crop based on these sessile critters.  Balloonforms were also cultivated from time to time, with millennia of attempts to use balloonforms in construction.  Flesh agriculture is what this mode of agriculture is called since their agricultural system works by a non-linear food chain where they prune unwanted animals by feeding them to the better animals.  Balloonivores complicate matters, but [[Fosskemian]] civilizations have in the southern hemisphere thrived off cultivating the balloon-like entities regardless (though they only grew advanced when introduced to flesh agriculture by traders).

The sessileforms tend to be pale in coloration with vibrant highlights of cyan, pink and violet, though they really take on any color they need to for attracting other animals to eat their gametes and/or be eaten by them depending on the situation.  Land sessileforms usually are balloonivores with 'harpoon' barbs and tendrils or have adapted to living off the seeds of ballooniforms.  The barb sessiles and seed sessiles form two separate phyla.  The barb sessiles can grow huge due to an evolutionary arms race between balloonforms and barbers which has gone on for the past several hundred million years.  These massive barb spitters are so dangerous that flight over land is considered extremely risky by the Fosskemians as a superstition.  It is a risk that they still factor despite jets being able to avoid barb shots adapted to piercing giant floating balloons.  The [[Fosskemian]] made liberal use of airships in their earlier pre-industrial societies centuries before the world conquest from the southerners in their seajets (amphibious vehicles are very common among their kind).
There are floating forests with tetherite phyla of ballooniformes on some continents.  

Fire making is done using stone and balloonfibre instead of wood.  Fosskemian metallurgy is built around combustible oils much more than our civilization was.  Fosskemian metallurgy didn’t develop beyond anything you saw on Earth however.

The more animated life forms are remarkably known for their use of large air bladders, the Fosskemians being no exception and they use these air bladders to glide, float and drift around the hilly environments and prance between the balloon trees.  These more animated life forms feed off the seesiles and balloons alike and have all matter of sizes, from the size of insects to the size of brontosaurs and more, occupying the seas and lands of this world.  

There are entities such as the Breathers, known for streaming about fire, large eusocial sea creatures known as the Amnobrine who are a staple food animal of the Fosskemians and fast moving, flying piercer packs who kill balloon forms and have whole colonies feed on the corpses of the balloons drifting in the ocean for nourishment.
The Fosskemians come from a clade of life which had developed two large airsacs to the sides of their bodies which the Fosskemians had come to use as legs and floaters, as well as something to slide around on in colder climates.  The bloated, blubbery nature of fosskemian Flesh ensured such lifestyle was viable and this clade of life was remarkable versatile with many different genii on their world.  

On Sul Vopal, the Fosskemians have proven their adaptability well through the wealth of civilizations and life styles their ancient ancestors had adopted to the general survival on a world so violent as Sul Vopal.  Metallurgy for the Fosskemians was achieved through a multitude of means, all of which outlandish to get better metal working in a climate little conductive to good metal work- it proved all too easy to get poisoned or the forge would catch aflame so more cautious methods were the norm.  Metals were mainly used as building material and for tools just like on Earth.

### Balloon trees

Balloon trees are sul vopal's standard flora, they're endemic to the place and amazingly adaptable.  They absorb lighter air for their has bladders, collecting methane inside of them that can combust into wildfires and make everything smell awful if penetrated, acting as a deterrent.  Their leaves and stems have much of the nutrition, along with various buds they produce.
