# Flux

## Overview

Flux is the homeworld of the [[Sarkic]].  While many home worlds tend to be wrecked, the Flux of the Cosmic Cloud has managed to centralize their ammonia world into vast world with a world spanning personality known as the Flux.  The Flux is said to be the word's whole climate system manifest with the massive population of Sarkic there into an overmind aided by technology that allowed for a global network of the billions of personalities distributed throughout the whole body of the flux.  They act in a timocratic faction, as the power struggles have petered out into a general governing body built on the numerous Sarkic they flow through.  That subsuming is a major taboo is a more recent phenomena, as is the attempts to include non-Sarkic as part of the local flux to mixed results.  

The Sarkic themselves have made all matter of fanciful ornate structures that affect and have relationships with the inclement weather systems of the world in ways that are "mutually beneficial" based on their conversations with the weather storms.  As inane as that all sounds, that agrarian yields are increased by how their behaviors seed clouds to cause more rain to happen wherever they aggregate.  This makes their world a bread basket for the Sarkic and other ammonia worlds species of the prospect.  

Most notable of these are the large, bulky and golemesque [[Pasis]] who are a major minority group on the world just due to also being able to live on the surface of Flux without much need for adapting.  The Pasis often build stuff on their own much to the frustration of the Sarkic, whose electric current based speech keeps tickling them instead of communicating a thing and translators being a mixed bag.  Still they converge enough they are liked overall just for the company.
