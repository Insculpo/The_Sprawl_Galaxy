## Overview

The Yelling is a noxious world called such for the incredibly human-like “yelling” regularly heard on the world’s surface with the methane geyser pump which the yelling beings thrive upon the updraft and a chemosynthesis existence, given the smoke filled, always clouded atmosphere and EarthLike gravity.  You get a wide range of life on a world where plantlike tends to be porous and sponge in shrubland like habitats.

### Sunshine mold

This environment is rather mundane beyond its more chemosynthetic nature, with predators, prey and such along with life who develop from mold to animated forms;

These are sunshine segmented, five limbed scum dwellers.  They're quite the trouble.
Life on this world tend to be rather smaller than earth due to not having earth's biological complexity due to being a primarily chemosynthetic, cold environment which probably would have been an earth if it wasn't for the distance from the parent star.  This muddy brown, dark, smelly world is horrid for every human sense.

### Breathers

The breathers are Flora that "breathes" on geysers and sunlight, it breathes continuously  in cycles as it absorbs the heat from its host volcano.  Breathers often are fed upon by other creatures due to how much energy they hold in their thick mushy layers, much like a cactus.  Breathers get really massive!
