# Imartasa

## Overview

Imartasa is a core world of the [[Balch Fleet]] that was a low gravity desert world made into a sprawling world for all life.  Imartasa is a world where biometallic architecture is far more fluid and curvy than the rigidity and dilliberations of the Urzine, with buildings often growing into and connecting to each other.  

The pinkish colorations and lights streak across Imartasa from orbit, with balch worlders freely coming and going from a large orbital ring structure that is shockingly egalitarian, at least as much as you can be for a multi species wonderland.  The [[Vilate]], Yalilu and [[Taysnoddl]] who act in tandem with Vopson, [[Utanguis]], Ivoltic, [[Sarkic]] and [[Fosskemian]] Balch denizens are in beyond harmonious coordination in ways that unnerve outsiders in the kind of actively anti-Dozinist biocollectivism that has gone to increasingly radical levels within the Balch.  Indeed this world is one filled with those working towards making weapons to slay the evil of [[Dozin]] once and for all for all eternity across all timelines.  All matter of super weaponry is experimented with in other parts of the system, all with the intent to rip holes in the fabric of reality itself to hit Dozin.
