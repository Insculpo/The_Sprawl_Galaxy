## Butusov

### Overview

Butusov is a temperate world with oceans of sulfuric acid.    The world is very flat and can be slathered in ocean sized high tides of acid, creating a highly porous, meandering terrain modified mostly by large crystalline deposits hundreds of meters in height.  These crystal mountains are a common feature on acidic worlds in general, and Butusov is of no exception.  These crystal mountains are where of all places the floral features of the world take root, along with vast bacterial colonies of chemotrophs who live in the surface of the crystals, giving them a whole rainbow of colors though usually orange due to their acidic exposure.
(Crystal abuse?)

This exposure makes the world incredibly corrosive and this forces the native life here to be highly rigid or lacerated in shape, having often layers of acid proofed hide and skin for their less regimental innards which also can survive in an acidic environment, but not as well as their hides which just near perfectly block out corrosion.  Much of the life, used to the sub-earth levels of gravity has come to view these crystal mountains as their home from the more dangerous flying swarms which thrive in the upper layers who come down to the lower layers for additional supplements.
