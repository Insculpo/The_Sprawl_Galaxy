# Webesten

## Overview

Webesten is a Mirage Thought ecology that had hosted a vast synthetic void ecology of fusion powered living bioships who act in concert with the [[Ivoltic]] pheromones that regiment all matter of species in communal ways, to create that perpetual bliss.  The perpetual bliss leads to a rather psychedelic environment, where the architecture is tainted in all matter of shifting sulfuric colorations and magnesium sparkling architecture.  Urchin-like structures often sprout around the ecology, as does fluid spaces of streamed organisms who act like larger collectives in concert to the perpetual illusion of the Mirage Thought.  It is a messy space, a swarm of micro-worlds that trade all matter of abstracted concepts with each other dealing with all the forms of happiness physically possible that transcends species.  The place is seen as toxic, as no one can be sure what they have actually done in the system, or if they even leave alive.  As the indoctrination of the Ivoltic is intense in the area, to degrees that disturb nearby societies and worlds.  Local activities vary since the locals tend not to really spend much time thinking.
