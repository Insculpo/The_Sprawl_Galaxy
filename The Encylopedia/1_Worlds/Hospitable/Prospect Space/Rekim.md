Rekim as a world makes use of some denser saltier form of water that leads to stringified organisms.  There is no actual flora on their world but sessile polyps with their massive tendrils filled in the niche enough.  The stringy organisms are colonial and the ecology is dominated by colonial organisms.  It is a somewhat warm oceanic world, with the salt layer being sharp enough there are megaplaktonic organisms who "float" on the denser salt layer to filter feed on detritus and small organisms that get caught in their tendrils like a massive sundew, passively farming such ecology through fruit-like outgrowths that act as the means to which it their organisms get entangled.  Many organisms live in this place regardless, as the risks of being consumed are outweighed by the benefits of the outgrowths enough to sustain a population and adaptation to them has grown to the point they actively defend the megaplaktonic floaters despite it predating on them.  This includes the [[Rekimites]], an intelligent species.
