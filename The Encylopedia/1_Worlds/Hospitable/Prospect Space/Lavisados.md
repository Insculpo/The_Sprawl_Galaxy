# Lavisados

## Overview

Lavisados is one of the large mediator core worlds.  It's a Terran world with steppe-like elements across a large share of its geography.  It is extremely cosmopolitan,  but extremely hierarchical.  The towering structures made to accommodate all of [[Dozin]]'s creations, the ladders that dangle from the extremely urbanized world's orbital ring hosting separate accommodations for the various beings of Dozin's world.  While the Mediator Gestalt officially is a secular society, it is never so simple.  [[Dozinism]] is the dominant faith by far on the world.  The will of dozin is enforced, even as they dress it up as a secular philosophy.   Lavisados is seen as a powerful faith world, as the site protected from the custodians by Dozin itself and was for a time a major center of power for a warlord faction.  

Lavisados is a major site of Purifier and ilver Legion recruitment, much to the frustration of the [[Mediators]] who know the world as one of theirs.  The An Appath were in recent times aggressively purged from the world due to their constant agitation causing dissassmbled Utanguians and isolated [[Vopson]].  This has created a vast environment of paranoia and conformist thinking out of feel of An Appathi corruption.  The vast vertical inclines of the cliff side highways on this world known as the struggle roads can be a sight to behold.  With ornate architecture paired with functional civilian architecture to create a highly anachronistic feeling series of cities on the world.  

### Lavis Siduf

The pack champion, Lavis Siduf and the multiple identities they had to go through from numerous injuries had given the world its namesake.  For Lavis Siduf is seen as the guardian of Lavisados from Ikeitan intrusions and the [[Custodians]] who were redirected to great success. Mind, the reality of this is much more murky, but it remains a powerful founding myth regardless.
