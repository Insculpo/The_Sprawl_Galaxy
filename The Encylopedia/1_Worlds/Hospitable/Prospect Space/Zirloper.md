# Ziloper

## Overview

->Make a better naming scheme

Ziloper is a Terran world where lots of radioactivity had led to plants that acted like natural fusion reactors fueling huge mega floral complexes and massive, titanic megafauna.  This world is also laden in phosphorus, nitrates, volcanic soil and borates along with beta radiation storms.  This led to vast biodiversity from energetic organisms living off extremely energy rich flora that had natural versions of fusion reactors to work with.  The world orbits a F-class star with peculiar compositions (mainly being a zirconium star) that have led to off colorations of the sun in the sky and the vibrant turquoise-white colors of flora on the world.  

Ziloper has been for a long time a world of massive interest to bioengineers due to the biomineral made fusion reactors it has, with it being in dispute between the [[Mediators]], Mirage Thought and Anti-Mirage lately since the Mirage Thought wanted to make the world a preserve while the Mediators wanted to do further research into the wide range of other fancy bio technologies they could extract- having already replicated growable fusion reactors from the world centuries prior.  The Anti-Mirage meanwhile just wants the world to be destroyed.

### The Sarthlomist Bulb

ï¿¼
The Sarthlomist Bulb has very bulbous properties.  They are very much like some organic fusion reactor.  The Sarthlosmists effectively are a delicacy, mainly due to their widespread nature being limited to one world and their usage as a grow able fusion reactor has not been lost on anyone.  It is not sure why this is possible, but it is.  One could wire sarthlomists together to fuel huge settlements while also getting oxygen and emergency food from them, making them a diverse utility in general due to the bio replication. The Utanguis who got some samples had taken them and improved on them ten fold, making Sarthlomists into hyper rapid regrowing energy systems that can be miniaturized for weaponry, civilian power and as an adhesive of sorts due to the roots.
