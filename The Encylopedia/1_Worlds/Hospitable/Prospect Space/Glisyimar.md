# Glisyimar

## Overview

Glisyimar is a prosperous [[metasyndicate]] world which is a series of interlocking, heavily urbanized rings that is notable for showing off the kind of Society a lot of composers aspire to make universal.  One where the flow and harmony of activities are free, with a mixed system where various organizations and associations compete perpetually with any stagnating, monopolizing forces actively busted.  This sort of world is an exemplar of this, being the site of many powerful metasyndicate conglomerates and collectives within the greater manifold of prospect space including the [[Jatarsan Rainbow]] and its wide range of gadgets it sells regularly and often.  The communities of [[Fosskemian]] egg makers and collectively owned synthetic body factory hubs show a weird post scarcity sense of perpetual competition that is fostered by a vanguard force of composers.  

The local seven composers of Glisyimar regularly undermine each other with their numerous agents with all the businesses and unions themselves usually being fought for under the larger mass agencies with no clear ownership.  That is one of the things to notice with metasyndicate entities, there isn't actually clear ownership of anything.  This counter intuitively fosters an alien form of individualism from what humans may see as individualist as everyone is an agent acting in self interest within the metasyndicate.  There is no trust of anyone beyond what has been cultivated over long periods of time, and getting too powerful often means the composers engineering your downfall for being a stagnant actor.  

On Glisyimar this agent oriented outlook is taken to its highest extremes, with construction done by automata primary and child rearing being done in part by nursery automata almost always without exception.  Biological parents do parent anyways but it often ostracizes them. However it is among the various extreme value breaks with even the symbiosis ritual that is widespread elsewhere.  [[Utanguis]] often aren't even connected, Ivoltican creatures get rendered limited, [[Vopson]] are usually isolated and [[Sarkic]] left with personal drones at most for company.  Needless to say the Fosskemian centric nature of Glisyimar's politics are evident but even fosskemians can have issues with egg rearing and traditional matriarchal institutions rendered meaningless in the face of the agent system.  

Overall the extremes of the Glisyimar cities are seen as the logical endpoint of the metasyndicate by detractors and a failed experiment by those who know of other metasyndicate worlds.  Often though, the inhabitants of Glisyimar went there by choice, and at times leave by choice.  The total disassociation of all typical ties is a hard one to do in the realm of Prospect Space and its many species, however great the rewards the composers make for it.
