## Ignivapora

## Overview

Ignivaporia is an ocean world on an elliptical orbit with blazing hot oceans to the point steam is deeply suffocating on the surface, with boiling water as a seasonal property.  Life here has come to exist in all matter of forms that take advantage of the heat pressure to fly through the vast steam currents upwards to the sun or down to nutrient rich tangles.  Tangles are like semi-sessile meshes of chemosynthetic flora that move erratically and cluster around storm regions and hot spots where steam stacks from underwater volcanic mountains exist that add to the already hot 70C oceans.  These tangles are mobile and omnivores, with tangles swimming in the hot gas to the exceptionally steamy regions of this global sauna.  

In upper layers swarms of organic floaters and gliders exist, often shelled and pressure based in how they move around due to the high flux of heat pressure from lower levels.  It is a very vertical world and it is believed the life here adapted to the progressive heating of its parent sun.
