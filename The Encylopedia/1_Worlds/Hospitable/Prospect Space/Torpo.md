### Illi

The illi are semi-sessile creatures on the heavy world of Torpo and they are basically pack grazers, they make use of a large dorsal arm that enables them to crawl and roll, needed on their grainy, high gravity world and eat by rolling as well, with lines of teeth across their body to soften the orange spread and suck it in with their many mouth slits and open gut system that surrounds the core body.  Their arm and "head" has large sensory eyes which see and feel in all directions quite well, much like how our eyes can be sensitive to wind variation.
