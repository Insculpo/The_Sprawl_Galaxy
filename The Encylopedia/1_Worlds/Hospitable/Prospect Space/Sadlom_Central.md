# Sadlom Central

## Overview

Sadlom Central is the current capital world of the Mediator Gestalt.  It is a massive shellworld with multispecies cohabitation built in mind, with winding passages and roadways all built on slanted gravity gradients.  The reign of Sadlom has restructured the [[Mediators]] a lot in recent times, as the [[Taysnoddl]] became a prominent force within the Mediator Gestalt as a synthetic entity.   The [[Utanguis]] pack councils have been wary of this leader, despite the polarizing vote among the packs that put Sadlom in power.  

Sadlom Central is a testament to the kind of city that [[Dozin]] itself would have made, with public ritual symbiosis streaming across all channels, gardens of platinum organisms, with brick-like structures angled all over the magnetized winding roads and tubes everywhere one goes.  The slanted mountain-like structures they come and go from, built for Utanguis living on slanted angles their traditional bodies can actually handle.  It is minimal in its accommodations to Fosskemians, who are marginalized heavily in the gleaming city.  Other groups like [[Vilate]] are much more accommodated for, allowed the frolic with minor constraints across the ecology of the vast rotating structure.  The [[Vopson]] handle all matter of other activities in the more industrial regions of the world, their gravity needs handled through vehicles they are stuck using.  Telecommunications are primarily handled by the [[Sarkic]] meanwhile, kept holed up in ammonia lounges that are nice and gilded.  

Such society of species castes is far more rigid than what had been the case in the past, along with the general marginalization of multiple species including the Fosskemians who are seen as literally the species responsible for the original sin as it were.  Being held even millennia later and after being extinct for centuries responsible for the Prospectors and their evils.  As is the Mediator Gestalt pretends like the Fosskemians aren't uniquely marginalized and loathed by them despite being species who pervade multiple large societies of [[Prospect Space]].
