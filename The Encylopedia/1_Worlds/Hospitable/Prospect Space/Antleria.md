### Geology

Anterlia is a frigid world with life that has come to embrace a cyrophilliac, radiotrophic style of living.  The T-life are life forms which subside on radiation from radioactive decay.  They are a common force on the neon rich world of Antlers, a icy super earth which remains geologically active despite speeding through a eternal abyss.  Antlers hosts the T-life underground and on the surface, which is shrouded in a sense, neon-rich atmosphere and a landscape of supercritical ices which flow about the cryogenic world.  

### Ecology

In this freezing environment, life is basically like living blubber, very plastic in body form and near statue-like in how slow they move about as they go stout their immense world.  Despite being one of the most ancient biospheres on record, the Antlerian sphere is still incredibly primitive seeming with brainless, nerve free body structures being the norm due to being mostly just a bilayer structure with an open gut (no tube) and no real circulatory system, just an ocean of bodily fluids which handle all these tasks without any centralization beyond of course the numerous specialized shepherd cells and what not.  

[[Cancer]] is simply ejected from the bodies here like any form of excretion, hell cancer is used as their reproductive method in some of the phyla.  For life here lives very long.  The advent of complex life is a fluke of two major factors- a presence of warm, radiative aquifers and rapid genetic mutation, so rapid they will mutate in form within a life span.  Antlerians have special properties with their hides used by predators- mainly their ability to harden when accelerating, which while starting a s a defensive function became a function used by predatory spheres where roll down hills to crash into their prey and consume the giblet remains.

### Antler Matter

Antler matter is associated with Antleria and is known for being rigid and slimy at the same time in the same temperature based more or less on kinetic acceleration.  It is slimy when slow and rigid when fast.  This matter is a property of the biology on Antlers and it has caused all matter of developments in regards to evasive defense, for it always fast movement and high defense while making a jump movement, making you that much more deadly when you move faster!  This material essentially allows you to go faster and faster while becoming more hardened as you do so, making you able to accelerate without much issue.
