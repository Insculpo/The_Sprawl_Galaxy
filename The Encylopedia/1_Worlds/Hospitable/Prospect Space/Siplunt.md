### Overview

Siplunt is a desert world that sprawls in its vast shrub lands and seabeds, with large savannas of fork trees and spine trees acting as the mating root for larger networked systems of nutrition absorption.  Siplunt has a wide array of life which live off the surface and subterranean roots, with life appearing in unexpected places due to the tubers within the landscape terraformed by the plant life.  Siplunt's life is incredibly dependent on aquifers and seasonal rains caused by the alignment of the stars.  The rapid rotation of the world caused a temperature distribution which remains rather homogenous due to the atmosphere being thick for the world's size.  The day/night cycle is actually rather chaotic, fluctuating between 2-7 hours per day.  This chaotic fluctuation has led to life that is absorbent and able to store food for long periods of time.

### Bladder Jumper

The Bladder Jumper is one of the kinds of life forms of Siplunt, with many tiny feet, a long neck that can dig through soil and large storage regions mixed with air bladders to launch themselves large distances in the lower gravity environment.  They can be frequently found clinging about the mountains.
