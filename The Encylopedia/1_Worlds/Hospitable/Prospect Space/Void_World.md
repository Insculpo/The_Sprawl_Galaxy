# The void world

![A Class Desert](/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/Photo_Directory/Void_World_One.JPG "A Class Desert")

## Overview

We do not know what went wrong

It was once a beautiful place

There is nothing left in it

Fallen

Neglected

Abandoned

Endless sand, in all directions

The poles. The equator.

All of it, sand.

There is evidence to suspect it was once a global ocean- there are massive regions where salt flats go on for thousands of kilometers.  

Worlds like this are common around A-class stars, where the maturation of those shorter lived stars overcomes all.  Where an ocean is reduced to desert.

The thick atmosphere has some residual water vapour, but photoevapprtation has since cleansed it of the times of thick hydrogen atmospheres.  

The kinds of stabilizing factors our world had simply couldn't save this world.  Its saving grace, what stopped it from being like Venus in its hell, is merely its persisting rotation.  So the kinds of build up that occur on slower rotating worlds never occurred, even as the thicker atmosphere homogenized the different cells.  

Again this is a searing world where everywhere is desert.  One countless worlds comparable to it- vast, world spanning deserts.  This mega earth however, is massive and dense.  It sports a radiation belt, one not strong enough against the heat of the sun, but one which protected it in the earlier eras.

Most disturbing of all however, is that life did manage to persist to the present on this world.

Not as we know it, however.

## White Patches
ï¿¼
The white patches as they are known, permeate around the world.  Complexity wise they are no greater than any bacterial mat- with only a billion years from existence to now, they were infants.  The oceanic past is unclear, only their extreme chemosynthetic adaptations.  They are halophilliac bacteria-like mats, aggregating the salts of salt flats into large concentrated highly reflective patches.  They seem to be photosynthetic a bit, but do not like to get much of the searing sun- indeed their salt aggregated suggests a defense system against the searing sun, absorbing the tiniest possible amount of light to avoid being toasted.  

Other bacteria-like organisms include the pale veins, which are more fossils than living things at this point.  There is no more complex life which could develop on this world, chances are if it was around some dimmer Star it would have been a world like [[Maraterna]].  No one is sure.  It is only abyss.
