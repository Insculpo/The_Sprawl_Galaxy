## Jiwar

## Overview

Jiwar is one of the prospect colonized worlds, a trade hub and ecological wonderland due to its wildly varied biomes hosting completely different worlds under the same skies.  
￼
A Jiwar smoke savannah.  The pinkish algal surface is kept clean by large towering stacks of CO2 absorbing rock-animal things that create much of the world's oxygen by absorbing carbon and exhaling oxygen.  The heavy greenhouse this world has from its strong volcanism was counted balanced by the Jiwar smoke stacks, allowing for this cold world to not suffocate while maintaining a strong greenhouse effect.  A peculiar equilibrium made more common in the universe by organisms such as these.

### Colonized Jiwar

￼
The central regions have much more activity than the more desolate polar zones.  The large inland sea is the product of receding salt flats from the polar regions that leave those areas very hostile places with life that one would be forgiven for thinking came from a totally different world.  Jiwar was the main hub for the Vusidian Dominion.  A deeply complicated population of competing apamus congregations of ancient mus factions descend from the utanguis

## Southern Siliconians

### Porcupine Rocks (humans call them this)

These things are just one example of the more peculiar kingdom of life on Jiwar.  They are spiky crystal filled rocks with more claylike veins which act as mobile roots they constantly are growing to absorb salt and minerals from the sands.  They tend to more more active in temperate seasons while being basically rocks in the hot/cold seasons.  There's many variations of these things, they tend to have a parasite-symbiont ecology where they absorb the nutrients from each other directly instead of predating.
