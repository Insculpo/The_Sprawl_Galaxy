# Milloc

Milloc is a lower gravity desert world that has extremely high vulcanism and thin crust due to being the secondary celestial object in the Vitloc system, which is an ocean world.  Milloc is the world where life in this binary experiment in panspermia originally occurred, in the hot springs of Milloc's toxic, CO2 heated atmosphere and acidified seas.  The life managed to through luck and attrition colonize Vitloc proper due to a range of bombardments around 2-3 billion years prior that sent simple life to Vitloc persistently enough some microbial life got a foothold in the Vitloc ocean.  Later however, Milloc life became much more sulfuric and followed the general sulfuric world archetype with the distinctively extreme vulcanism offsetting what would normally be a rather cold world- indeed it had frozen over in multiple occasions in the past, recovering mainly due to the world's carbon cycle picking back up just enough.  The extreme hostility of the world makes it seem like the impossible world for life, but it manages.  Milloc is a world with a highly vibrant ecology of elongated climbers, grazers and flying as a common feature due to how easy it is on a world with a thick atmosphere and lower gravity.  Milloc life has the unique characteristic of widespread conic body structures due to the dominant phyla having a conic endoskeleton that depending on the order in question can have exposed segments.  These conic organisms easily dig into places to set up ambushes, build burrows, twirl through the skies, parasitize and take on sessile life styles in the acidic seas when not having some of their orders act as the world's de facto flora.  They can get into all sorts of shapes and sizes, but tend to be more pointed and cylindrical due to the low gravity favoring those shapes.  The sulfuric nature of the world makes them highly colorful organisms, often being purple, red, white, yellow and in countless shades.  The corrosive nature of the acid means they're rather crystalline, as whole some sulfuric worlds have rubbery and plastic this world inclined to crystalline and plastic on the whole as the salt deposits on the world were commonplace.

Vitloc is the largest world of this binary planet system, which has Milloc as a close orbiting planet to Vitloc which leads to intense tidal flux.  Vitloc's oceans have massive oceanic waves as a result of Milloc's tidal pull that affect the importer biology, of which came from ancient Milloc life spreading to Vitloc.  On Vitloc, cylindrical organisms became dominant after a Cyanobacteria equivalent became widespread on the surface of the world in the cyan sheen epoch, which evaporated due to the quad lateral complex organisms forcing a diversification of coloration and all matter of organisms in the depths of Vitloc coasting off the large tidal waves that ripple across the world to the time of Milloc's rapid orbits.  Life here is on average, large.  Hitting blue whale scales is common in the modern biosphere, in fact a small Vitloc organism that is fed upon by second order predators would be around the size of a dolphin.  Smaller organisms just do not prosper in this environment since the tides make it harder to hide and size was what became most selected for leading to gargantuan ocean world beings as colonial aggregates increasingly pervaded the world as organic ships.
