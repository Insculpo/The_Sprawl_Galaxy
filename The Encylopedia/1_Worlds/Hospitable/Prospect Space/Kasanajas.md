# Kasanajas

## Overview

Kasanajas is a prominent [[Urzine Domain]] volume mainly due to being a site a lot of more juvenile [[Ikeitans]] go.  They do a lot of weird stuff, predictably like asteroid pushing, gravity well skirting or ganging up on each other.  Elder ikeitans often are stationed at Kasanajas to act as guidance for the Ikeitans sheltered at the region for their rapid growth into hyper powerful death ships, but they often are pretty loose about checking in.  The local worlds in the system happen to be festering in [[Lasuuko]] colonies that are orbitally bombarded by the lil' Ikeitans out of boredom fork time to time.  The Lasuuko seem to not mind it, others want to even be crew of bombardiers.  The pathological nature of these local Lasuuko cultures has made them almost like the dolls and action figures these Ikeitans use, making little stations for them and pitting them against each other.  As these activities make more Lasuuko often from all the amputations, the Lasuuko like participating. Outsiders who go here usually are somewhat miffed by the place, as it's just like some star system wide daycare center for lesser Ikeitans who haven't had much need or regimentation for the greater Urzine fleet.
