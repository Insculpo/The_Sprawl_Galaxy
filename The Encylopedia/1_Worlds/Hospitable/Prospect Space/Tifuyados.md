Tifyudos is an oceanic world where it is cold enough ice bergs formed.   It is a somewhat high gravity world but the high atmospheric pressure makes that gravity not all too important for the local ecology beyond the low buoyancy cap for floaters due to the air density drop off just a few hundred meters into the sky.  That buoyancy cap would led to a competitive ecological dynamic, to say the least.   There is no moon in orbit of Tifuydos, but the size of the world compensates for that.  The world is over 2.6 AU from its parent sun with a tiny eccentricity in the orbit and a small axial tilt.  Despite that seasonal cycles exist in the form of iceberg forming and thawing seasons the quasifloral life has had to orient to in order to colonize the surface.  The lower parts of the world go 40-45 km deep where an aquatic rift created the backbone of the ecology that floated up the convection currents and colonized the ice burgs. 

These icebergs were colonized by algal life that would form the basis of complex flora analogues on the world as they developed distinctive systems of stems and mycelium-like webs that could handle ice.  They initially were reliant on atmospheric heat that came to the surface from the sun but as the skies became more biodiverse varieties that fed off the detritus and polyps of the floaters on Tifyudos became commonplace. 

Spadegliders are a core aspect of the ecology. Where they filter feed algae and spores from updrafts.  Their deaths also create temporary rafts decomposers will cover and live off of, with creatures in the deeper ocean feeding off those creatures and what remains sink to the depths once the buoyant parts of their bodies are eaten away.
