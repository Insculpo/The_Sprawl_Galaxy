### Overview

Crimson is an earthlike world in orbit of a M1-class red dwarf star which has plant life highly acclimated with the sunlight it gets.  In regards to the animal life you get  lot of life near the ground more than the trees, though the higher gravity environment means you see much more life on the ground.

Crimson's distinctive red colored grass plains come from its Early red dwarf parent sun and minerals in the soil that slant everything down a reddish path, including the megafauna of the world which has taken to preferring hexapodal vertebrates such as the crystal necked hammerheads who graze on the red grass. The sky coloration is because it's an early red dwarf, which means that sky colors don't get yellow as they would for a dimmer late red dwarf. Sky colors are complicated and can be very impacted by non-star factors such as rust in the atmosphere, inflections from strong color producing gases or aero bacteria. None of which really are factors in the skies of Crimson. There is a significant amount of water vapor and air pressure, however. That leads to cloudier skies than on earth. The grazers aren't that big, being around a meter tall and often come in packs. By all accounts, this part of the world is remarkably earth like.

### Blood Trees

Blood trees are from a earth-like world, notable for their vibrant orange trunks and red leaves with numerous sour berries embedded underneath the viscous leaves which are blade-like protrusions.  They are notable for having a system of long roots that interconnect with other blood trees overtime, creating a web of trees capable of merging together to make larger and larger systems of fluid transport.
