### Overview

Siversial is an acidic ice world of incredibly layered natures, being a frozen mars sized world kept warm internally from the tidal flux of its parent planet and over four moons.  As a result of these multiple tidal pressures, Siversial is a chaotic world filled with shifting hotspots.  It is remarkably shallow for an abyssal world such as itself, only reaching as deep as ten kilometers and with icy cave systems and pools locked away by upper rocky layers being common.  The sub glacial ocean holds a vast range of life adapted to all these biomes.  One of these creatures being this Veemers whose kind has managed to spread across much of the world even as cold and desolate the upper ocean can be.  The life here is just as loose and transparent as the Veemers, with all matter of composite amd colonial organisms permeating the world.

### Hook Minds

Hook Minds are one of the more higher-level kinds of life on this world, existing in the more cavern-like regions and making use of echolocation to navigate the upper "lava" vents for ice flowers.  They are related to the Veemers.
