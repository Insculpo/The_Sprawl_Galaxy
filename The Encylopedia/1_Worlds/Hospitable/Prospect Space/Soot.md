### Overview

Soot is a world of ashes and emptiness, weak in water content and so the carbon biominerals usually substituted by other forms of .  The ash covered landscapes however, hide a enigma.  Soot is a carbon world whose smoke filled, inky atmosphere betrays the fuck the world is like this due to massive colonies of umbral bacteria.  Umbral bacteria made Soot a pollen filled. Hair riddled and beast like.  Soot's biosphere is not that developed, but its influences have been clear in the endless carbon desert, with dirt painted by raining ink on a regular basis.   Soot is around the size of Earth and in "distant" orbit of a late K class star,  it the native umbral bacteria absorb so much light it isn't really clear if there is any diamond at all. The geological activity of the world is highly inconsistent with a diamond world- that is, this world shows regularly geological activity!

### Ash Cleaners
Â 
The Ash Cleaners are a frequent sight on this worl.  The Ash Cleaners thrive off the particles of micro organisms which rain from the skies and fester on the fields of Ashes for lichin-like substances and pollens from the dust trees.  They tend to be immobile and coalesce into forests of ash cleaners where much of the life exists on this world, as these cleaners take on the role of trees despite being more like clams than trees.
