# Hatursados

## Overview

Hatursados is a densely, densely packed world flooded with [[Vopson]] and other swarm integrates who share their identity with the Pale Swarm.  It has pale landscapes that host the vast underground cities filled with Vopson, as the subterranean environments were massively habitable for these Vopson who flooded the place with their foods and grow to absurd numbers in the post-custodian environment.  The vulcanism of the world is easy to cultivate into the sulfuric acid streams needed to make sense vertical meat complexes the Vopson feast on.  

## Acid Minds

Acid minds are known to originate here as an AI system that emerged from flock interactions and various elaborate chemical computational systems who impose a higher order.  Of which gives the Hatursadians the ability to be so dense and efficient with its populations.  

The Acid minds usually are fluid AI, using controlled corrosion and erosion along with many vector vopson who act as conduits to the greater swarm mind to think.  Acid minds are like the sub routines of the greater swarm minds, often having even narrower goals or otherwise just doing all matter of patterned behaviors that act as their signatures.
