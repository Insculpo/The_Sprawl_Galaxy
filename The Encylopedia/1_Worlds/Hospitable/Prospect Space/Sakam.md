### Overview

Sakam is an acidic world filled with sulfuric acid and it is viewed as related to [[Fuedisar]], though Sakam has an archipelago geography.  Sakam also is far more volcanic and sulfur has shaped the whole world, molding it into smooth terrain and crystal deposits mixed with a vast range of colors caused by the varied cooling of the molten sulfur volcanism.  For this is a world with a sulfur heavy upper mantle.  Life here tend to be violet in color or shifts in colors to camouflage among the splattered terrain of the world.  The life here has very latex or rubber-like skins and there is no actual flora equivalent- the "plants" are temporary states for life on this world, transitioning between sea oriented larvae and sky oriented adults which have come to dominate this world.  Such metamorphic megafauna is everywhere on this world and in many shapes/forms.  Why life here is so land averse?  It is due to the lack of tides, as while the parent sun causes tides, they didn't play enough a role to make land oriented organisms instead of flying organisms the dominant ecological force.   Acidic life tends to melt and make use of digestion methods very different from ours due to everything already being acidic.   

## Colonization

Sakam is split between the Mirage Thought and Plastic Swarm with a wide range of sulfur breathing species colonizing the place.  Many live in sky cities instead of on surface, where large natural reserves exist.  As does a lot of defenses to keep the cancer away from the distinct sakamian ecology.  Still, one sees in regions clusters of roosts that have seen local Sakamian megalarvae in the moats of, deliberately made.  The Plastic Swarm's regions of the world have a lot of these roots, with a general sense of wanting the environment but beyond their vertical roosts are mostly unintrusive with most resources imported from orbit or the local moon.  The Mirage Thought meanwhile has trouble actually existing on planet outside their [[Whandl]] and [[Zakkai]] clients, who intermingle with plastic swarm Vopson and Whandl a lot.  The Zakkai hate the gravity and air pressure but those who live in the Mirage Thought's Spires are more used to it.  Mining sulfuric crystals on Sakam is an obsession among local [[Vopson]] with all matter of domesticated Sakamian organisms.
