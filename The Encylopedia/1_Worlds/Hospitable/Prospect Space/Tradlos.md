### Overview
Â 
Tradlos is a world which has numerous strands of minerals amid a hilly, fragmented and stressed landscape obscured by the heavily forested landscape.  In orbit of a K-class star, Tradlos is a super earth with high geological activity as a result of being within a binary system.  Tradlosian life is generally heterotrophic and more lithotrophic than our plants- as the highly volcanic soil has enabled all matter of huge crystal reliant sessile forms to make their carbon forests, with jet black wood and dark green leaves.  They spread more like fungus, having multiple metamorphic states and spore based reproduction which all alters the nature of this world with its bubbly seas and 3% CO2 atmosphere making it hard to breathe for human life even if the world is livable for them (though expect to cough a lot and deal with all sorts of nasty ailments from the food).

### Tradlosian Tree

Tradlosian tree with mega fauna. The larger base is needed due to the high gravity environment, trees tend to have thick stems for their leaves and branches and still droop.


### Tradlosian Tanks

Tradlosian wildlife is highly mobile despite the higher than usual gravity, for their squat forms are able to pace themselves amazingly rapidly and make use of thick, shell-like skeletons to resist the forces of gravity on them.  One of these are the tank forms:

Their forms are highly blocky, with a mouth at the front and rapid pacing feet.  The two heads they have are large sensory spines which limbs protrude from and they segment, allowing for amazing diversity.
