### Overview

Tangerines is a sulfuric acid world with clear, wispy beings whose air bladders and six eyes navigate a media of foamy fog and lakes of acid.  With a more rugged surface than usual due to many asteroid impacts and a more active geology, Trangerine manages to host considerably more biodiversity than most acid world biospheres.  It is a world with similar gravity to earth but of radically different air pressure that has led to very different sky oriented life and very different modes of locomotion entirely due to the silky and resistant air bladders endemic to their dominant phyla.  It is a pretty mellow, temperate world despite the highly acidic composition with weak storms and incredibly stable weather cycles which the native life are genetically engrained to for their migration patterns and their life cycles.  As per usual, life here is quite resilient to sulfuric acid as quite a few of them literally breathe sulfur.
