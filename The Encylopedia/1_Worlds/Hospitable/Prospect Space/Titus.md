</h2>

### Overview

Titus is a low gravity world with the conditions that enable huge, rotting eocystsem within itself spread across various biomes and regions in multiple sub-forms.  Titus is a arid, savanna-like world with a inland ocean and large deserts.  It’s cold and much of the water is found in huge underground oceans formed by the limestone rich geology of the world and the world’s initial origin as a rogue ice world which dried up.

### The Roots

Roots are a biostructure that gets both solar and geothermal energy.  They are found in low gravity worlds with extreme degrees of wetness usually.  Roots spread for kilometers on end and grow for millennia before decaying.  They aren't a centralized organism, their their top layer often conspiring of a myriad of wood-like structures and large solar collecting plants.  Roots often become hosts to ecosystems inside the rotting parts of their bodies, attracting decomposers to them.

### The Toppling Peak
 
A mountain formation whose erosion has been reduced by numerous plants and roots holding the structure together hosts a vast range of arboreal, mountain inclined life used to living hundreds of feet above ground within the mesh of roots and vines which drape the hanging peaks.

### Findlers

Find lets are streamlined, tentacled vertabrates with trilateral symmetry.  They're remarkably fish-like creatures, or would be if their structure wasn't trilateral.  For the fish-like part of a finder is its outer shell more or less, with a longer more squid-like form making up the interior of the animal that can shoot out to catch prey quite effectively.
