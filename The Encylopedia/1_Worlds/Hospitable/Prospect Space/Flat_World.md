# Flat World

## Overview

Flat world defied all known logic and conventions when it comes to super earth's due to not being an ocean world despite having a mass comparable to Neptune.  It is the largest known terrestrial object of its sort in the Galaxy with an advanced biosphere and the high gravity environment on this dense world has led to extremely bizarre life.  Much of which slithers or crawls, like massive panels molting about the landscape with meters deep oceans and the largest organisms being inches in height.  Nothing flies here, even rocket propulsion would have a hard time getting off the ground.

## Flatworlders

And worse still, intelligent life has arisen here in a totally alien sense of existence.  For they tend not to even think of the sky, these massive brainy panels kilometers in size, instead they live in a closed universe of incredible superstition and ongoing territorial disputes in a world on perpetual decline from their perspective and they don't want to leave it ever.  They like it here and see the rest of the universe as plain hostile to their existence.  They are amazingly slippery in movement, taking advantage of gravity pressures to cause lurching motions.  The ammonia is death for the bulk of them however (due to drowning, ammonia is their solvent outside of that).

## Colonization

Flat World was a world the [[Vopson]] found and just didn't know what to do with.  The world was too dangerous to go down to, they hate it.  The Plastic Swarm didn't have any idea what to do with them, but the [[Ivoltic]] in the area tried to spread their vibes to them to limited effect, flat worlders are just hard to talk to.
