# Giparna

## Overview

Giparna is a hostile [[Metasyndicate]] ran cluster of installations in the neutral zone between the Mediator Gestalt and Metasyndicate.  It is also a Waywardian world, as the Waywardian Union has a powerful presence on it as a force that seeks active independence from the Composers.  Waywardian are multi-species but are very much [[Fosskemian]] in origin.  They created powerful entities across the neutral zone where neither the [[Mediators]] or Metasyndicate could dominate that actively work in a fraternity acting in their own common interests.  [[Waywardians]] occupy most of the seats of power on Giparnia and have tried to create a society that doesn't have any sense of species in their greater goal of fulfilling all matter of post-species goals.  

They want to break with species barriers entirely to make the whole, to free themselves of the horrid paradigm they are in.  And Giparnia with all its species has become host to that vision, as 30% of the population uses the suits much to the frustration of the Composers who have a harder time manipulating those with the suits.  They created a more stable, orderly society where multiple species can actually find their own ways instead of the ways of arcane belief systems  To what success they have actually achieved that isn't clear.   What helps the waywardians is that the harsh weather systems and geology of Giparna mean countless nooks and crannies for the Waywardians to do as they do, with their adaptive skins encrypting everything.
