# Ivikurmaja (The Gleaming City)

![Ikeitan City World](/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/Photo_Directory/Ivikurmaja "Ikeitan City World")

Ivikurmaja is one of the major urzine cities, a dark cityscape where the thralls and crews of the ikeitan bioships fraternize and associate.  The organic sprouting and districting has led to the distinctive spikiness of the design, with gravitational manipulation fields regularly used to allow for rapid vertical construction.  Some of these cities can network up to orbit, allowing for the urzine domainâ€™s populations to be unsettlingly spread out and vast.  Crew members of the ikeitans in their vast collectives and gestalts poaching each other as non-crew groups fester about.  

The cohabitation of species such as [[Vopson]], [[Utanguis]] and [[Fosskemian]] have been easy enough- prior societies have created the common architectural framer for such cohabiting for millennia- however the integration of beings such as the taysnoddl and [[Glinnvyr]] have complicated matters along with other crew species such as the yalilu or [[Asantum]] and even lost diovierme colonies.  Challenges that cities such as Ivirkurmaja have surmounted by having adaptive, living cities who intelligently reshape their infrastructure to the general make up of the local population in the region with the helpful coordination of rogue [[Jama]] AIs and lesser coordinator beings.
