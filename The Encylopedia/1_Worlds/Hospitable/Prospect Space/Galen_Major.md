## Galen Major

## Overview

Galen Major is an ammonia rich world with a vast range of tiny organisms who instead of becoming complex life as we traditionally think of it, have an ecology of many composite gestalt swarms with microscopic bodies that transfer electric currents to creature beings that to us seem to either be invisible or as a metastable mesh work of electric sparks.   These spark formulations seemingly preempted the emergence of complex life entirely, their glittering existence being once of subsumption and energizing from local storms in an ecology of various Metastable bioelectric swarms of microscopic conduit creatures which flow into each other in a way that makes evolution a very convoluted deal as species systems don't work here.  It's more like classes of various metastable electric swarms directly associated with each other with different emergent behaviors.  

Still they exhibit gene transfer and natural election, but the process is different in how species seems to be secondary to the aggregated electric swarm constructs almost all organisms of any complexity are on this world.  It's not clear why some ammonia biospheres get organisms of this nature instead of the more solidified complexes of tissues and organs usually seen with complex life.  

The general theory is that when these electric cloud beings occur, they outcompete more primitive forms of complex life and so maintain dominance on worlds where the atmospheric pressure and magnetosphere create an environment with the high conductivity Galen Major is known to have.  The ammonia seas are mainly kept liquid simply because the world is too warm for ammonia ice to occur but cold enough to keep the existence of the world ocean.  The world ocean seems to act as part of the world battery that Galen Major is.
