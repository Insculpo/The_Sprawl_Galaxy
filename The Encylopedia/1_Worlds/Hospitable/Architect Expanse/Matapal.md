ï¿¼## Overview

Matapallian organisms are an emergent set of complex fluid liquid nitrogen systems that rely upon the anomalous quaternary planetary system Matapal is built around.  The two core worlds and the two outer orbiters- along with numerous asteroids.  The inner worlds are comparable in size to Earth while the outer worlds are around Ganymede sized.  This is a world where something is horribly horribly wrong watch out there is something horribly wrong it is an emergence catastrophe beyond any hope and dreams everything has broken down there is no hope or dreams the slush is but the patterned fluctuation known as the Matapal.  

The cryogenic thought flow of the Matapal has no real comprehensible origin.  The magentosphere has been completely distorted by it, creating elaborate glowing systems of movement to which it hallucinates its consciousness openly to the universe on timescales far greater than our own.  Baryonic life entities it has willed into existence from the depths, forcibly adapting them to liquid nitrogen through sheer attrition and lightning it could induce with its geological perturbances.  It isn't seemingly a conscious being yet the many tiny inner moons move in ways that have been observed to distort from the great shepherds.  

The complexity of the system is such it seemingly is living.  To others it is a sign of reality's very break down.  The nitrogen entities on the worlds are logically absent, they are more like husks which the world uses as tools to regulate and more precisely augment itself.  The orbits of the outer worlds seem to even allow it to steer.
