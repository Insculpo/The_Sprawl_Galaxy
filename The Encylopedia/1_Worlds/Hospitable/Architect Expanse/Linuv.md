Linuv is a [[Vmiskii_Empire]] world notable for having floating continental plates as a minor feat of [[Aveterriat]] antigravity geomagnetic engineering.  This allowed for mantle access, where tireless strip mining of Linuv's mantle continues by the high ranking machinists who got the privilege to work themselves to death at Linuv.  The massive population of architect denizens here are enrolled to learn to labor on the continental shelf as they see the professionals do their work and demonstrate that work so their current incarnations can too labor as great as they.  The multi species collaboration has logistical hurdles but none that couldn't be overcome through sheer will of spirit and the use of the working shells endemic to aveterriat dominant societies.  The Linuvian model of multi species labor has been of interest to other factions within the empire, showing and demonstrating the true universality of reincarnation in the great network of essence that pervades the universe once and for all.
