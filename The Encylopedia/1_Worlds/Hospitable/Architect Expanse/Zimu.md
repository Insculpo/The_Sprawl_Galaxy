## Zimu

## Overview

Zimu is a super earth that as far as super earths go, is surprisingly dry for a super earth with 87% ocean cover only. The large world size was complimented by a massive amount of phosphorus which has allowed for a biomass much greater than most worlds.  Enabling the creation of massive sprawling complexes of flora that are multilayered into floral megastructures that appear to us as stepped pyramids which house all matter of octopedal organisms that hug the lattice to avoid the crushing 1.3 G falls.    

Zimu organisms tend to be massively dense and thick as is, their many stubby limbs being adapted to the navigation of the massive biomegapolis of the world.  Such stubbers mostly exist towards the ground, with other phyla managing the upper layers tenuously.   The largest organisms live in the regions outside the pyramid shaped megaflora.  As the Zimu Ball is perhaps the most iconic organism of these worlds.  Where these organisms are like huge rolling balls braked by their limbs to get around the relatively flat biomes between the massive floral pyramids which often are found dominating regions rich in fresh water like lakes or river deltas.  

The massive ball megafauna has a tendency to crash into floral pyramids and feed on stuff within, making them an ongoing dread but the floral pyramids have many adaptations to the massive ball organisms in the various sizes they come.
