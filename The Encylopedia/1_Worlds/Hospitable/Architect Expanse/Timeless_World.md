### Overview

The timeless is a grey goo catastrophe site.  While no where near the exponential destruction of the violet.  The skies are yellow from the waste heat of the crust of dead nanites who died from overheating themselves in their exponential consumption.  The heat energy didn't stop them from slowly devouring the whole world however, as they devoured it slowly are painfully for all those involved, as the civilization which destroyed itself blew itself to the Stone Age and unable to do anything to stop the slowly advancing silver.  They petrified the life on their world, leaving whole forests of shrink wrapped, shriveled trees and megafauna.  The slow devouring led to a grey goo biosphere, in practice it led to a dead world because the nanites all flamed out, superheating themselves to death when they began eating inwards on their planet and evolving to eat to suicidal rates, nullifying what allowed them to survive in the first place.  The world is in a runaway green house, thousands of degrees in temperature and even devoid of artificial life.  You can walk on the world, though it's no easier than walking on Venus.
