## Overviewï¿¼

Ijarnosis is a large world in orbit of a white dwarf where life has persisted into being dark blue radiation absorbent flora and fauna.  Life on Inarnosis has to deal with exceptionally harsh conditions such as an atmosphere that had been thinned by a Nova event, high gravity and the little sunlight from the white dwarf Ijarnosis orbits.  The heating from the red giant phase incidentally made life able to miraculously survive to this day stronger than ever.

Life here is scarce and extremely hostile, after all.  Ijarnosian fauna is extremely dense in biominerals such as calcium and cobalt, but one may find the material properties of their bodies anomalously smooth and made iridescent from the radiation storms.  They are often able to blend into the rocks bathed in heavier minerals from the Nova catastrophe, having had nearly a hundred million years since to adapt to the decaying conditions of their world.  And from the radiation of the local white dwarf, having become literal titans.  Intelligent ones too.  The Ijarnosis Titans being the biggest shock, these massive elephantine beings whose massive stumpy legs and extremely strong prehensile trunks have allowed them to make a rather flat yet productive series of cultures on this hostile world.

The convoluted geography shows regions that have recovered from the heat bath where life permeates most.  The local fauna often has to crawl about the high gravity environment, just to get to the glass Savannas.
