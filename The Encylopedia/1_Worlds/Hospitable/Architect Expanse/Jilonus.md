### Overview

Jilonus is a rich, wet world with clear skies and high, boiling temperatures in orbit around a sun-like star.  Jilonus is filled with borrowers and a distinct absence of life systems like earth, mainly their moving red autotrophs which dominate the slowly rotating world which sees long periods of day and night, and so all the life constantly is migrating away from the burning sun.  And it is from here you get various other forms, mainly parasites and such who move with the red migrators and the cyanosessiles who live underground very often and love to trap the red migrators for food even as they too need to borrow away from the burning sun, even with their resistances.  Microscopic life have not much need to adapt, they are used to these fluctuations and simply harden to high temperature.
