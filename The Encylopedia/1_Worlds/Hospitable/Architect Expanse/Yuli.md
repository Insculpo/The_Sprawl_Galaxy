## Yuli

## Overview

Yuli is an iron rich world with seas of liquid carbonyl and a fair amount of gold, platinum and all matter of other heavy metals.
Amazingly there's life here that has utilized these metals to create highly conductive energy vampires that dominate the world.
Life here is all about sapping energy and more uniquely, has a layered organ structure where their organs are arranged in strata-like fashions.
Instead of encapsulating of cleaving, their bodies stratified into bellies of gold and backs of aluminum with iron cores.  
These substances are mixed in a range of silicates that interconnect the main metal layers to create the rigid, prism shaped beings which fill the world.
They're shockingly fast in movement despite that due to the high amount of energy on their world to work with from their boiling F7 class star and being on an iron dense world so hot rock is a tarry fluid and pools of iron carbonyl are prevalent.
Not much in the way of flight exists, but there is a subtle form of hovering wildly used by complex life on the world alongside various micro organisms that zip around on electric currents that can screw up ships in their own right.
They reproduce by breaking into new shapes instead of by breeding.  These shapes are shaped by natural selection and the more common shapes prevail.
