# Lacra

Lacra is a mostly aborted world, with vast sprawling wastes hosting mysterious stony machines who are far more advanced than they first seem, indeed those who interact with them are often taken aback and fall into existential questioning about everything assumed about cosmic history.  The less you overthink it, the happier you will be.

## Lacrox

The Lacrox is one of the most fascinating megalithic structures in our galaxy due to its incredibly high age of 970 thousand years- making it among the longest surviving structures known.  It is made from a reddish stone native to the world of Lacra known as Strip Stone which basically is a incredibly hard to mold kind of rock due to its insane combination of straining resistance and difficulty to erode.  Strip Stone in this context is an alloy made from the salvaged ruins of some earlier civilization still lost completely to time.  This enigmatic Lacra structure is highly protected and one of several all made from this same material which is actually a computer based material because these structures are evidently a mind upload archive, though efforts to restore the information is impossible due to the sheer cryptic nature of the storage methods.  They are essentially fossilized computers with alien minds lost to time.  Is it still living or dead is impossible to determine.
