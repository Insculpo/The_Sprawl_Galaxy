### Overview

Kyruvi is a world which always had a liquid nitrogen layer beneath its surface and thus, instead of developing a thick shell with a ultra deep ocean developed a liquid nitrogen ocean where life emerged. Kyruvi is just one example of the incredible diversity of icy worlds in conditions not often seen.

### The Porlor

The Porlor are a highly vicious species who live in the depths of a cold world subsiding in liquid nitrogen, explaining their highly transparent and frigid form.  They are everywhere on that planet, basically the only complex life in the world because the plasticity of their DNA is so huge that they can breed with any others on their world.  Which means a general semi-homogenization occurred in their ecology over time as competition decreased from the initial explosion of life.  It is of great mystery how they became multicellular in the first place.  Still, they are often used in coolant tanks as a deliberate muddier because their skin mucus enables all matter of benefits for the storage and use of liquid nitrogen.
