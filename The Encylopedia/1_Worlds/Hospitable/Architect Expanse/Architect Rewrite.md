#Architect Architect Rewrite

A huge rewrite for the Architect, with the [[Glinnvyr]] as the main species now?  Yeah perhaps...

Once
We had a dream
A grand dream
Manifested across the cosmos
We had sought a communion of it all, 
Once but beings from an icy world
Who arose after the ancients fell
To build higher than them

So we worked towards such goals
Millennia it took

We came across the [[Aveterriat]], they were industrial
We angered them, they fought back against us
Their colonies spread out far and wide
In loose coalitions of worlds
Across hundreds if not thousands of light years

Things happened, lives came and went
Our lives became defined by the architecture as the architects once had envisioned

Vast networks of artificial worlds with inclement weather systems

We broke from the paradigm of planets entirely
We became a civilization of builders
A civilization that figured out the systems of the Sprawl, 
We made them work upwards once again
After millenniums of destitution

Than it happened
A strange, impossible development
The [[Custodians]] happened
There was a massive conflict, on scales not seen since the dream war

The ascension war

A vast mass virtualization on scales without precedent- virtualization had been common before in parts, but not on the levels the ascension war had reached

Perpetual, pervarsive, all consuming
All was the metaverse
All were forced to be part of it
A long conflict ensued
The Custodians expanded, they came into conflict with other established entities of the architect.  The Chromatists and the Vmiskii being the main checks on them.  The Modulus, Long Conferation, the Domain of Ovatar, the Plated Networks, all surviving on luck more or less.  Ancient sins had come to roost in the eyes of many of the Architect, millennia ancient evils from earlier activity within the Sprawl now left the galaxy with the Custodians of the Metaverse free to flow into it, flow they did.

They spread to other galactic quadrants, expanding the vastness of the Architect's activities to large swathes of the galaxy

The Architect as an entity isn't fully galactic, but their activities expand as far as the galactic core at times- only rebuffed by the extremely powerful entities that dwell in that part of our vast galaxy.

-----------------------------

So where does this leave us in our understanding of the architect?  Rather limited.  The architect doesn't have the same clarity of the Civic nor the vast sprawling depth of space opera alien civilization of the Prospect.

Indeed, the Architect isn't thematically meant to be space opera hellscape like the Prospect.  It is meant to be more foreboding, cryptic and unknown.  The alien's aliens.  

What separates the Architect from the Sprawl is the Sprawl is meant to be a rotting, wasteland of an entity.  Advanced, yet broken irreversably.  A fallen network of societies kept alive only by automata.  

The Architect is more mystical and warped, living and breathing.  The site of megastructural activities orders of magnitude beyond the Prospect or Civic, but not being the automata corpse the Sprawl represents.  Nor the degree of anarchronistic flaire.  Spatial warping is common, activities on larger scales is common.  They are living titans and undoubtedly the most powerful entities in the sprawl connected galaxy.
