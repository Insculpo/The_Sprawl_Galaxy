Dersera is a world known mainly for being a frigid world with seas of hydrocarbons, hydrogen metabolism and organisms that simply are tiny and fast as the dominant strategy due to the gravity being just low enough and the air pressure being ever higher from outgassing caused by gravity flux in the trinity world system Desera dominates.  The life here has managed to be very floaty and jumpy, with cells so large you see them in simplistic threaded systems dominating.  The life here is very cushion-y and bouncy as well, depending on the phyla you are discussing as Desera is a vast frigid, foggy world of numerous sub-biomes caused by multiple sub-solvents such as liquid nitrogen seasonally occurring and cloud mountains depending on what century it is.  Cryovulcanism here speed liquid ammonia, which is a spring of nutritious biomatter from the depths for life here.  

The ones able to sap it without burning themselves, anyways.  It is a a scary world for those not used to the life here, as organisms tend to have asymmetrical body plans with various specialized organs.  Colonial clades and the semi-lateral segmented organisms lead to a freak show of a world to those accustomed to symmetrical organisms that aren't oily and so cold that they have liquid helium blood.  The organisms tend to be grainy and pasty, with all matter of magnetic spikes in some cases and an extreme reliance on sound, density sense and fluidity.  They have a weird lack of flora beyond cryovulcano dwelling thermophiles (by the standards of Dersera) and mold, but do have various migratory photosynthesizers who fly with wide wing spans trying to get what light they can atop of their usual hunting.
