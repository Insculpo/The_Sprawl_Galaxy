Angval is a world found in the [[Architect Expanse]] that is extremely bizarre on the merit that it is an extremely oblate world the size of Earth that rotates every 2.5 hours and has been doing so for billions of years while retaining an atmosphere and going on to develop complex life that thrives on the vast winds and aquifers.  Angvalian life even developed to tribal intelligence, where they have only known a world with very short days and regions that are pain to traverse due to the tribulations of the crushing those regions host.  The rituals on this world have centered around the crush ritual, seeing how much of the tribulation lands you can go where gravity is harsher and the world colder and stale.  They know a harsh life, with a historic asteroid impact causing the world to rotate 2 minutes faster.  These organisms by the way, look like flying worms.  The crush comes from how the gravity gets to high for them to do anything than crawl as opposed to the liberation of flying in the high velocity winds that connect their societies.

## Angvalians

Angvalians are natives of Angval, a low gravity ellipsoid world with a rapid, rapid rotation rate.  The shifting gravity of the world has been a constant challenge for them, with their settlements usually being lined up in the places with the most stable gravitational cycles while having to go into different gravitational biomes for the best organic resources the world has to offer.  They are flying hexapodal organisms, with a slender and wormlike feel to them, mainly due to their very segmented and wiggly bodies that are a product of being invertebrates on a low gravity world.  While their homeworld is small, it is still a huge place for them.  Many cultures exist more adjusted and adapted to different variations of gravitational pull, with ethnic lines almost being aligned with the gravity anomalies of the world.
