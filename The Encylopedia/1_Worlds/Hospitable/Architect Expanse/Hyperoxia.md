### Overview

Hyperoxia is an oxygen rich ice giant, with a balmy tropical temperature and a wealth of oxygen spewing bacteria that gives hyperoxia some of the greatest oxygen quantities in the known galaxy.  The gravity of the world is little more than Earth, the storms are never ending and vast fire storms frequently fill the skies.  

The life of Hyperoxia has through this energy rich environment exploded into a state of biodiversity unimaginable without the sheer volume to which life has been able to spread across a world bigger than Neptune.  It is in Hyperoxia's massive fire storms that entire ecosystems come to life.  Hyperoxia life is very developed, but no truly sapient beings ever appeared.  

### Hyperoxian Cruisers

Vast colonial aggregations have managed to make their homes here, waging wars across the clouds in swarms.  These Hyperoxian cruisers as they are called represent the apex of life here, and the thousands of species who live within them.  They do all this without so much any sign of self awareness at all.
