A static crystalline world where endless terrains of geometric fractals and stable crystal geography with a paste-like fluid found throughout large spans of the planet. The quartz crystal pillars appear to actually be the byproduct of lithotrophic reefs. It is all so much more elaborate than that, as the wind patterns also are unnervingly stable. The two bands of clouds in perfect 0 degree tilt characterize the planet from orbit, without the idiosyncratic elements seen elsewhere. The rotation is not fast, but it isn't due to tidal locking or a slow orbit resonance. It just isn't fast at rotation. The temperature gradient from the poles to equator is a stable one to the point they basically mirror each other.
