## Overview

The foggy, violet skies of Messina host a peculiar remnants of some civilization that attained for a time, planetary level civilization.  Their descendants are the product of the erosion.  Their species have been too grand.  It had managed to mold the biomatter on their planet, which is remarkably like clay and fungi, to all matter of impressive architecture.  Of which amazingly has kept intact over the millennia from the claymold entrenching the shapes.  Messenian descendants still exist, but they are tribal around the world to this day.  

This world of living clay is one which has all matter of cyan flora, these sprouts are germinators and donâ€™t grow leaves.  Their spores are why the clouds are so violet, with the yellow clays being what they grow and layer the world with.  Indeed the world has quite the high amount of biomass from layered moldclay.
