## Overview and Geology

Somber is an oceanic world drenched in darkness and life, the dismal cloudscape and orange haze lying over brackish waters.

Somber is an oceanic world with little air pressure which orbits some distance away from its late-K class star.  Averaging a temperature of -14 C and having a thin atmosphere has meant that the oceans get very cold on Somber, to the point where Somber has ice caps.

Somber’s world spanning ocean extends down on average 30-50 km, with no land to speak of.  Somber has been blessed with a geology from the chaotic moon system which creates the highly varied oceanic tides the world experiences on a regular basis.  The winds can be howling fast when the days turn to nights, which is usually defined as going from the dim, gloomy and cloudy seascape to one which is basically pitch black except for the light from the moons seeping through the thick atmosphere of Somber.  

Somber’s depths consist of a very rugged terrain with massive underwater mountains and harrowing trenches that shape the current flows of the world.  Of which are intensified by the underwater vents and rifts which claw across the planet.  Hotspot regions have shifted over the millennia, creating a layered terrain made from various calcium and salt deposits.  

Many resources, especially minerals rich in rare earth metals can be found in the hotspot regions of the world or in the desolate, fossil-like mountains which over the ages have been sculpted by the currents of the ocean.

## Ecology

Somber’s ecology, due to the distance and thin atmosphere tends to lose its energy from the sun to space.  However, the energy is more than enough to ensure a pump of minerals from oceanic flows between the various latitudes and regions of the planet.  The deeper, abyssal layers of the world benefit greatly from the detritus which planktonic life from near the surface have given.  The colder upper sea layers mark a barrier to the deeper, chemically reliant organisms who have the noticeable trait of being highly electric, much more so than life on Earth.  

It is not sure why this is so, but it would seem life on Somber has become very reliant on magnetic fields as a sensory system and are able to use various patterns of jolts for a shocking range of applications.  Be it predation, defense, mating, communication or movement.  Life on Somber also tends to be transparent to human eyes, much like deep ocean life on Earth is.  Life on Somber also has a tendency to have many, many heads in a hydra-like fashion, of which have specialized to various sorts of limbs.

A protoform of intelligent life does exists, but they are incredibly primitive by nature and huge, amazingly huge.  Bigger than whales.  Their tech is very simple, with much of their advancement being in their own biology and ability to communicate.  They just never had any need to advance, being more or less content with being the masters of Somber and having no real means to go to the stars anyways, not that they see them given their unwillingness to traverse up towards the frigid surface.
