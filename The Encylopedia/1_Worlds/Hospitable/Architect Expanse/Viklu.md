### Overview

Viklu is a dense, rooted and ancient world located in the outer parts of the galaxy notorious for its volatility and dense forest cover, which is exceptionally massive here due to the numerous islands the world consists of, with dozens of oceans and archipelagos being the norm.  Indeed, Viklu is an earthlike archipelago world of great interest due to its life being similarly green, but much more so- green covers the branches and trunks of the flora.  It is more like many massive shrubs and ferns than trees.  The Viklu are filled with all matter of toxic fungi and a deep catalog of fossils due to how ancient the world is.  With multiple sapient life forms having come and gone in the isolating, cloudy habitats which the world is dominated by- some got to Iron Age levels, others however have been limited.  The [[Vilkovum]] are the most widespread sapient on the world in current times. Why this world has seen multiple sapients from different genii is unknown, only that they have managed to fail to spread across the daunting mega earth of Viklu.  Even interstellar colonists would have difficulty penetrating the environment.
