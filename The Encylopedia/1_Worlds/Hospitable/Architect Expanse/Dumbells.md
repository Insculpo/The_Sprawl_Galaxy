### Overview

The Dumbbells are exotic alien entities who appear on a cold, icy world with a thick carbon atmosphere with low gravity and lava flows.  Their forms are highly elongated due to being symmetrical from four sides and being essentially hoppers.

### Mega Dumbbells

Dumbbell entities are commonly found in large groups galloping about the frigid landscape towards grazing regions (usually made from internal volcanic up swells) and using their form for parasitic applications as well, for their form enables such parasitism with the larger fauna on the world which they inhabit.  They are as big as a human and the life they patch themselves to parasitically are around the size of dinosaurs.

This is one of those mega fauna creatures, these arch grazers are massive and feed from their legs, which are spindly but well suited for the tiny world which they exist on.  Such mega fauna roves in packs and is highly territorial and irritable due to the parasites.  They grow to the size of whales and so are very easy to spot.
