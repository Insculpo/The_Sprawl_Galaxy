### Overview

  
Name: Alkud
Thalassogen: Alkaline Water
Temperature class: tundric
Crustal class: thick
Atmospheric class: slow cycling

Alkud is a cold, oxygen rich world with alkaline water; whose ancient biosphere and moderate  gravity well mixed with large land areas, dense, yet non-concentrated deposits of minerals (there isn't much geological activity on their old, thick crusted World) and soupy climate has allowed for a shocking array of creatures who are able to modify their own DNA at will (Or bioforming).  

**What is a bioformer?**

Bioformers are a rare kind of life, as their analog to DNA is capable of much more self modification than our own.  They are able to adapt while alive and modify their DNA while alive to optimize for those adaptations.  That seperates their DNA from most forms of life where without advanced technology or some assisting symbiont there is only genetic selection through reproduction.  Meanwhile the bioformers only need to imagine their children in different forms to change their appearance and often radically so.  Such organisms rely on considerable abstraction as a result.  The beings of Alkud vary widely in their "intelligence" between having life which either replicates clones of themselves or makes many radically different forms from the same womb.  The flexibility of such biology led to the [[Hilbado]].
