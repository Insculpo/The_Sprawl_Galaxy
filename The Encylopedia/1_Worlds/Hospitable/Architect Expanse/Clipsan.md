**Overview**

At first glance, Clipsan appears to be akin to most hydrocarbon worlds.  Something that exists at the behest of its jovian overlord, small by comparison and one of many.  That is not the case with the ice giant orbiter known as Clipsan.  Clipsan is less a moon and more a binary planet.  It is a larger world than most Jovian moons tend to be, being around 4600 km in radius.  Density wise it is weaker than earth, but the tidal forces of the Grand Violet keep Clipsan orbiting in a resonance which causes cyclic cryovulcanism.  

Despite the sheer size of Clipsan for an icy world, the gravity of Clipsan is not strong compared to a terrestrial world regardless.  The hydrocarbon, octane metabolizing creatures from Clipsan including the [[Glinnvyr]] themselves are very spindly.  

**Biota Analysis**

The converging body of the whole Orthogontia phyla which exists on Clipsan was a development from the need to be able to move in the quickest direction.  On such a world, backwards/forwards became a disadvantage.  A more complex body which takes less to achieve a result slowly evolved.  Of which was selected for as the octane based metabolism of hydrocarbon life continued to prove useful for an oily existence.  The present day ecology is full of such Orthogontoids, once again the Glinnvyr included.

**Glinnvyr Activity**
 
The Glinnvyr arose not long before [[The Rupture]] had occurred.  Their small, unassuming world in orbit of a moon comparable to a warm Neptune (-100C temperatures, it is a warm world for hydrocarbon seas) known as Clipsan was for millennia gracefully orbiting The Violet Essence itself.  The history of the Glinnvyr ever since 11000 BC was regarded as a marginal one in the galaxy at large.  The Glinnvyr were antisocial apex predators dominating some icy world at the edge of the galaxy even the enigmatic Archivers rarely cared to visit, not the builders of civilization.  The Glinnvyr at times formed loose bonds, paired for coupling but otherwise solitary.  The intelligence even in such planet bound times however, was shockingly advanced.  The Glinnvyr had managed to go into states of deep thought.  They could not move and think at the same time.  But something changed them, their patchworks of weak connectivity had made advanced tool use but there was a beckoning beyond their world and all of existence.  

**A mysterious Signal**

The [[Harlapa]] signal washed over their world.  They detected the signal because it was so loud and clear.  It impacted their atmosphere, a glinnvyr known simply as The Listening One, or Ukulunus.  Ukulunus had managed to be reading radio signals as a hobby they personally pursued and managed to pick up the harlapan wave.  It was something that was picked up by the listening associates as well, all the same signal.  It was a vastly disturbed frequency, it caused panic attacks to those glinnvyr that listened to it.  They had no idea what the fuck this was and it only got worse and worse in its attenuation and detail.  Dread swept the world, chaos broke out.  The loose individuality of the glinnvyr was falling apart.  The prismatics would emerge as something unprecedented in Glinnvyr history- something able to align enough Glinnvyr to break out of the prison that their world had become.  The Prismatics were willing to carry out centuries of experiments just to get off of Clipsan and understand the harlapa wave (which wasn't recorded well).  For more information on how that panned out, refer to the History of the Architect.
