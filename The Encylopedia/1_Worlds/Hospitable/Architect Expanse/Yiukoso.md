</h2>

### Overview

Yiukoso is a large, diverse ocean planet with a vast array of life hoisted by its hot temperature and being shallow enough that hydrothermal vents can exist.  This has allowed for very developed life in time, using underwater mountains to grow complex and eventually take to the skies.

### Droppers

Droppers are gas bladder filled critters found on a water world, droppers are large creatures who are light, but remarkably resilient to impact, in fact they derive a large share of their nutrition from the heat from air resistance they get when falling from the heights the upwards wind currents take them.  They get energy from the sun as well, but they most enjoy the sensation of impacting the water, and the surge of heat they absorb from it.

### Spaghetti

The spaghetti is a term used for a large floating megafauna found on some water worlds that is a medusa of sorts, making use of numerous air bladders and the wind to move itself about the world.  This is just an example for Vuikoso.  They're much more carnivorous than your typical floater.  Its tendrils are retractable and usually only come out during feeding or mating sessions.
