### Overview

The Violet storm is one of the deadliest regions in the known universe.  It is an ancient nanoswarm which roams the Galaxy devouring stars and civilizations.  It is so dense in its material that it appears as a peculiar nebula to the oblivious eye and has to avoid succumbing to gravity constantly, thankfully it is in a different part of the Galaxy around 67K Ly and it is to show that the universe is so much stranger than we realize.  And that we are far from knowing just to what depths the Galaxy has fallen.
