### Marble Grazer

Marble grazers Stoney critters with a blocky build that dwell in the armored forests of HIP 103639 d, a Terran world where calcium rich life has come to prosper as the dominant life form.  Marble grazers are pack critters that graze on muck and seeds on the forest floor, along with any small insects that get entangled in their glue-like slime.  Lots of shelled creatures and paste dwellers exist on this world which is amazingly toxic for us.  They are like [[Phidians]] in many regards, though are lacking their sapience or fluidity.
