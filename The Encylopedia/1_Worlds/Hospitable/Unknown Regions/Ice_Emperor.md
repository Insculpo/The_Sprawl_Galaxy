## Overviewï¿¼

The Ice Emperor is a super giant planemo.  An ice giant of ice giants, within a binary system with a helium giant.

However what the Ice emperor holds fascinates much more.  It has a Sammanian colony somehow.  This world, many light years away has a Sammanian colony- with its ecology being Sammanian.  They exist on higher layers due to the pressure differences, but overall adapted to the different gravity well fairly reasonably with the Sammanian clade here all working with something that is in the system.  The enigmatic ice emperor.  Its origins are cryptic- it is a massive entity and viewed as a deity to the local Sammanians.  

It is some leviathan, we don't know the nature entirely only that it dwells in the lower layers of the ice giant and sometimes has been seen patrolling the upper layers as an amorphous, dark blotch on the world itself.  Its systems and workings are unclear, its logic and motives unclear.  Communicating is hard, however it is know that it is highly territorial and its placement in interstellar space makes it hard to really affect.  It isn't contiguous, more a vast cloud of...  things.  Things which somehow managed interstellar travel and transplanting organisms it found in the depths of some distant Jovian world.  

No one has any clue how to deal with it as the risk it may adapt to whatever is used is always present, and the obscure location (being in interstellar space and all) makes it hard to even reach.  Locals still thought it a good idea to set up helium mines on the helium giant in tow...  however ill advised the action was.  

Much concern the ice emperor is using the helium giant as a way to steer the planet is common.  As it has at times shifted to the helium giant and outgassed in a way comparable to a fusion thruster...  disrupting climate systems massively on the helium giant.  Even if the ice emperor is indifferent to local helium miners, it is still very dangerous to the people who thought this place a good place to mine.
