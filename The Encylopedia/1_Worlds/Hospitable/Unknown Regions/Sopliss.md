### Overview

Sopliss is a sprawling desert outside the polar temperate regions, with things get lying less habitable the closer to the equator you go.  This strongly affected their cultural development as it meant they had a small world to explore and the geographic barrier for them seemed impossible to surmount.  The Sopliss wear around them a symbiotic plant which they use as a means of giving sense to their world beyond which can be understood, mainly due to the parasitic take over of their mind giving them hallucinogenic perceptions of where food the symbiont wants which happens to also be edible by the [[Soplo]] is goes.  These head features are very common and are used to collectivize themselves with a sense of being that they otherwise did not have and the non-plant cultures find absolutely demonic.
