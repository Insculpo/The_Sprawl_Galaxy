Gulibi is an oceanic world in orbit of a white dwarf star whose irradiated atmosphere has created a post-nova oceanic ecology that would grow spiky mega flora whose towering nature comes from them being mega-radiotrophs that are attuned to the radiation waves from the white dwarf this cold, Cold World orbits.  The oceans stay fluid mainly due to being extremely salty seas, as photoevaporation from the nova extinction event and the boiling of the seas lead to a lower sea level.  However it was not low enough to get to the surface of the world, but did get low enough phyla of tower building organisms stacking upwards became feasible as organic sea stacks.  The magnetism of the star is used to tether the structures into perpetual towers on the tidally locked world.  The only reason they are vertical here is because it is the hottest region of the world, facing the white dwarf itself constantly and soaking in radiation constantly.

That development has allowed for sky cities to merge as sky ecologies formed around the high layers of the mega radiotrophs.  There are additionally treaders and sulkers who take advantage of the radioactive briny oceans, sifting through it for goop, prey and catching whatever flying organisms get too close.  The tiny brine organisms are so prevalent the radioactive brine oceans get a purplish coloration. 

1- Tower directionality alters based on the location on the planet, leading to crazy slant tower spikes that stream across near horizontally.
