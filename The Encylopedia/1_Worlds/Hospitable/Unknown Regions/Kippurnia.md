## Kippurnia

## Overview

Kippurnia is a blazing hot world where life is deeply aggressive.  But slow paced.  Their somewhat gelatinous skin and various specialized organs.  Their low reactivity makes life here very resistant to the various acidic substances which exist on the world.  They are large organisms for a world with high gravity, but this is because of their body structures being absurdly tough compared to traditional carbon life.  Kippurnian fauna can come off as large globular entities with sets of limbs.  Shell-like structures appear frequently as does  oval their vibration oriented biology that gives them a density perception of the world.  

The varying densities are important in knowing friend from enemy, knowing what organs to feed on and where to strike through the rough skins of their opponents.  Kippurnian organisms usually have 9 limbs due to a mixed body structure from both gravity pressures and chance from prior extinctions.  Some of these limbs receded into the bodies, others often specialize three of the limbs to absurd degrees.  Kippurnian sulfuric acid dwelling is a mix, as it is in a realm unique even by sulfuric acid world standards.  While sulfur has many electric properties, it paradoxically led to highly insulative organisms.  Electric fields still are a common issue with Kippurnian life due to the kind of sulfur being hot instead of the cold sulfur of a world like [[Liduzum]].
