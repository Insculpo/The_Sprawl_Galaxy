## Dolot

### Overview

Dolot is a low gravity world with a size around that of mars.  It is the smallest world in a trinary system that gives Dolot the tidal stress it needs to survive. with an anomalously massive biomass caused by its signature noodles to which their whole ecology is built around.

Life on Dolot is incredibly used to the low gravity conditions and its amazingly high, wiggly and unstable environment caused by kilometers tall flora which build needle-like mountains covering much of the planet.  These insanely tall structures are a product of the incredibly high phosphorus deposits of the world, the use of biofilms with similar properties to that of space elevators and the extremely fused nature of the noodles.  These noodles will fuse into each other, creating many layers of undergrowth that can go down for kilometers further in some regions.  Life has come to also seed the water world and barren world, though the Polo are only common on this one noodle filled world.

### Polo

The Polo are exclusively arboreal, digging them sleeves into the noodles to hunt for parasites within them and tend to be very solitary.  They can survive very long falls on their world thanks to the low gravity and they take full advantage of that.

The Polo eye system is very different from ours, for their limbs are their eyes, with light sensing in their hook-like arms, legs and spinal limbs of their spindly, hexapodal body plan accented by a dorsal frill used to control their movement while in air.  Their mouth is at the center of their body below the hexapodal fin.

For the Polo are are stringy critter from a stringy, noodle filled world.  It is hard to explain, imagine is there was vast wiggly forests of many layers going down dozens of kilometers in some of the most massive biological constructs of Darwinian origin in the known Galaxy.

### The noodles

The noodles are the primary biome of Dolot, for they hold 74% percent of the whole worlds biomass due to their vastly long, 3.7 km high noodles which feel upon seemingly endless supplies of phosphorus which seemingly defy the laws of biology.  Enabled further by the low gravity environment of their world.  They act as the baseline for the vast and complicated ecosystem which occupies itself at numerous layers from the densely packed, carcass filled and firestorm infested floors to the thin, low oxygen stratospheric regions where they arc radially in multiple directions to absorb more sunlight along with their general food source of decomposing biomass, geothermal energy and phosphorus rich soils.  

These noodles are immortal biologically, and so never ever die, just keep on growing until something breaks them and even than more noodles are bound to grow out of them- in fact you also will get branching noodles from seeds which borrowed into other noodles and now parasitize on their own phyla.  They are massive and diverse, through tend to either be white or yellowish depending on your altitude.
