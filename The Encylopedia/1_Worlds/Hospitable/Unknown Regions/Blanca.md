### Overview

Blanca is a helium rich gas giant in orbit of a neutron star that has attained exotic peculiar life.  It is not a huge gas gaint- being little bigger than Neptune,  but it is one that has radiation from the white dwarf and energy from a stable storm cycle the neutron star provides with its energy waves and vast shares of nutrition from multiple cannibalized icy worlds.  This is a world that survived a super nova, the life came from bacteria who developed to complexity after the super nova through updrafts and lightning storms.

Said life is oriented around a strong pink coloration, something that is an artifact of the bacteria which permeates the world as a whole creating rose colored clouds and causing life to range from pale to pink depending on how full they are.  Blancan life is massive, comparable in size to space craft, but also extremely light weight and reliant on wind currents, indeed often at the mercy of them.  The helium however, has allowed for buoyancy that would be considerably harder in a gas giant with mostly hydrogen instead.  The pink life here is mostly planktonic, only doing small adjustments in migration patterns and the predators even tend to be passive ambush predators who try to align in the way of prey via wind currents instead of actively chasing them down.
