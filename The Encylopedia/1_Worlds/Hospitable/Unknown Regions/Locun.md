### Overview

Locun is a high gravity world notable for having life that looks stunningly like that of the [[Ivoltic]], this is because Locun is an Ivoltic world, simply one that doesn’t acknowledge the fact due to how they broke with gravity orthodoxy to live on a high gravity world and culturally degenerated back to a Darwinist ecosystem much to the total horror of the other Ivoltic clades.

### Sardoids

Sardoids are segmented megafauna with heavy protection due to the higher gravity environment they live in making falling objects hurt more, so life on their world evolved more protection.  Sardoids feed off large core parts of trees on their world located near the base of the spiral trees, using a twin proboscis to suck out tons of nutritious and gooey fluid. They also use it to fend off rival suitors and to suck the blood out of larger animals for their gooey innards.  They show very clear markings of the typical Ivoltic diggers, but are far stumpier and stock in build, lacking the long legs typical of them and having many less tendrils sprouting from their backs.
