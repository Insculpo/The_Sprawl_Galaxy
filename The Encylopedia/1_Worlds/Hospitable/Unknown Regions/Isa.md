## Overview

Isa is a world that is a massive, massive rocky world which has only a cm thick layer of life across the surface, colored red.  The life here is more like a massive mat that devours itself more than any actual biosphere, just some massive organism that eats itself to sustain itself with the sun that pierces through a relatively thin atmosphere being used for energy.  Isa life hyper stable by life standards, with no real notice of evolution, just self devouring and any other forms of life if they existed likely having died off long before the current day (micro organism cultures are everywhere, however).  
 
### The Red Mat
Â 
Isa holds the Red Mat super organisms, which are colonial organisms whose strength is the product of creeping around on Isa.  It is just this absorbing, consuming red mat that will crush you into it if it touches you- even when taken out of its natural environment for the combined strength of the mat is massive, to the point where it can crush a human into a pull around a few inches in size with relative ease.  Red mats are naturally very heavy too.  They have many black specks that act as gametes to seed new parts of the mat encase of asteroid strikes or some disease (indeed, the mat has lost whole regions of the world due to some cancer or disease- and probably will one day be reduced to extinction because of this).  Still, they do have their applications due to the ease of adapting them to other environments (they're not very needy and the crushing thing is to even to predate- they just do it by habit to expand themselves over terrain).
