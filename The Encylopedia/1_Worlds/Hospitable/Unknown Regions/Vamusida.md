### Arc plants

Arc Plants are a very EarthLike specimen of plants notable for their gill-like leaves and their unique alternating root scheme which allows them to dig up hillsides much like vibes, though with shocking stability.  These weave in and out of the earth much like runners do on Earth, but unlike earth they have some lithotropic properties and thrive off calcium.
They show clearly animal-like properties despite their slow movement, mainly in how they actively sense the world around them and expand in directions along with retract, with shocking speeds at times as well.  They move their core seed around whenever it is in danger and this property is seen in the many sub-breeds, including those which are cultivated by the Vamusk.

### The Svallik
 
Svalliks are higher order organisms who have entrenched themselves in the mountains of Tartuffe and are grazers who thrive on the arc plants.  Their appendages make them very arboreal creatures, using the arc plant webs as their media of movement as they live off it and look for mates- which is the primary reason why they move, as they are quite solitary and large creatures who are mostly hunted for their streamers which are used primarily as a mating signal and stimulator.   They have four eyes which are vaguely connected to their streamers.
