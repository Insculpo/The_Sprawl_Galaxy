### Lithohydras

Lithohydras are very slow moving, rock dwelling creatures that live deep underground and thrive off of internal heat, minerals such as lithium and thermal heat factoring into their life style.  Often found on more geologically active worlds where such energy and minerals can be found in high abundances.  They also may feed off sessile underground critters.

### Biocrystals

Bio crystals are organic creatures that thrive off geothermal energy and the up flow of nutritional minerals from volcanic vents.  Bio crystals store tons of food within them over time, mainly due to the need to keep food over when geological activity is weak.  They grow crystals as excreta more or less and are hard shelled to defend against both feeders and against the pressure the world around it exerts.  They reproduce primarily by budding roots, growing new cores in what can become huge systems of interfeeding biocrystals.
