![Radiation World](/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/Photo_Directory/Adina.png "Radioactive World")

## Properties

Name: Adina
Mass: 0.77 Earths
Orbit: 0.67 AU
Plausibility: Impossible due to use of iron carbonyl(!!!)

### Overview

The radiation rich world of Adina is smaller than Venus yet has a gravitational pull as hard as earth.  Adina's density is also mixed with an atmosphere of rusted iron where dark orange seas and dark yellow skies are the norm.   Adina was mostly stripped of its crust eons ago and has managed to develop life adapted to iron carbonyl.  A mixture of stony highland and iron lowland can be found on Adina.  The temperature is unbearable by human standards, with the local life even practicing aestivation.  Such life takes on magnetic properties and so many life forms have managed to hover on Adina, exploiting repulsion from the surface and using magnetic flux to kinetically sling themselves around the terrain or navigate the seas through energetic charges.  Life here also uses radio waves to stun prey, shout and even merely see by sensing other radio sources.  Adina is a biosphere where radio and magnetic forces permeate.  

### Ecology

The life of Adina feeds mainly off solar energy and make use of energy vampirism, never devouring prey.  Instead they feed off others by metabolic vampirism of a form alien to carbon based life forms using the conductive transference of magnetic flux.  Transferring energy directly instead of needing chemical metabolizing processes is a property distinct to metallic life.  For the Adinian body systems have more in common with machines despite following Darwinian evolution.  Adinians still make use of many organic components, such as insulative, rubbery layers of protection and vibrant white plastics as a chitin equivalent.  Reproduction methods between different lifeforms is at a similar diversity to our world.  Life on Adina is kept alive by Adina being in a binary system with a stony world bigger than Adina known as Sparfeld, yet orbits Adina more than Adina orbits it.  

### Adinian Alloys

Adina is host to various Adinian ultra-pure alloy systems found in the shadow of Sparfeld mainly.  Adinian minerals can be made into a special kind of 'crystalized' steel of a purity only found in this galaxy on worlds like Adina and worlds like Adina are incredibly rare in the galaxy.  These purities are also caused by lithic bacteria within the allows whose excrement purifies the metals, as the bacteria live off the impurities in metal.  These purity germs indeed have been widely sought.
