## Overviewï¿¼

The Vlanch is a desert world which is highly porus and desolate.  The Vlanch has very red life and almost all of it is colored reddish colors to best absorb sub surface chemicals.  For chemotrophs dominate this world, their slow, snaking movement patterns boring tons of vent-like holes throughout the world.  The critters involved as really the colonial creatures who easily break apart, branch and spread about.  The Vlanch life is very much the kind of life to leave one feeling wanting for more.
