### Overview

Exolith is a world where you get crystal-like Lithic bacteria who go to the surface in what are incredibly massive fossil formations of hibernating or dead bacteria.  It is the poster child world for this kind of crystal-like bacteria adapted to subsiding off radioactive decay and pent up energy in the rocks impossible without these conditions.

Bacterial forms tend to stay underground where it is warmer, but geological processes may drag unlucky populations upwards to the cold, but slowly enough that they eventually adapt to living on the surface of a cold, dying world without any Suns for light years.  This phenomenon is a product primarily of the selection to which the trauma of being flung out of a star system causes- so you end up with hardy bacteria to begin with that only get tougher and in exceptional cases, even develop to a higher demanding life state:
