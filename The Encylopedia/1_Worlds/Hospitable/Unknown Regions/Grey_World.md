### Overview

Grey World is a grey goo biosphere.  The grey world emerged after a collapsed industrial civ, as they tend to.  These nanites however, developed much more cellular networks and because massive, slow moving living aggregations of large machines stacked on each other. They also come in many shades of light yellow and light violet.  But this machine biosphere is known for its absence of evolution, instead using a limited set of forms and rapidly dwindling species count until only a few will be left, out competed by one species who will rule the world without competition or need to mutate.  Such static behavior seems to be what the ultimate goal is, and so for them is good news.
