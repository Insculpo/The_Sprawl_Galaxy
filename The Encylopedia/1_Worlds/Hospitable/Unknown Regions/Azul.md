### Overview

Azul is a dark, cloudy desert world where highly lithic life has thrived among the mountainous savannas and volcanoes, along with the icy poles and such.  It is a dim world, but its inhabitants are bright- cyan bright, caused by the copper intake they have gained.  It gets extremely, extremely dark here at night due to Azul not having a moon.

### Cyan trees

The copper rich nature of the world has lead to savannahs with distinctive, rich blue cyan trees.

Cyan trees have amazingly deep roots and usually thrive in mountains.  Their blue color comes from the quality of copper they absorb, and can also be clear and white in coloration.  This mineral rich tree glows at pure twilight, to attract all manner of pollinators to its solitary, rusty existence as cyan trees due to their deep roots are relatively solitary in the volcanic mountainous Savannah.
