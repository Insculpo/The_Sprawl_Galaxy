### Overview

In the depths of a large planemo, living off radioactive decay is the skimming.  An ancient, lovely fellow who has been around since the beginning of the universe who has took billions of years to evolve.  A world consciousness akin to the [[Ivoltic]], but much more lethargic and solely based in the abyss of a frozen world where no light shines- beyond the occasional glow of the decrepit core tugged upon by a major moon which the Skimming managed to stipulate exists, even getting its mass, density and orbital trajectory down perfectly.  It has also grown itself to the surface of its world, in massive ice flower complexes.  Some of which would go on to colonize thousands of light years of space with their incredible resilience and immortal seeds- a feat which has been envied perpetually by so many.  It has known of space, but has no desire to go there even if its children do.  The light years of separation and lack of good materials along with no good way to transport the world has made it not want to do so, in fact the Skimming has with its biowizardry developed skimmer sails designed to keep the binary system away from any stars.  It is deeply hostile to anyone who gets near it, killing anything that it senses warping in on sight using a mass driver complex it has established all over its planet.  There's a several entities like the skimmer out there, but they have very different outlooks, and most aren't at the Skimmer's miraculous ancientness or slow advancement.
