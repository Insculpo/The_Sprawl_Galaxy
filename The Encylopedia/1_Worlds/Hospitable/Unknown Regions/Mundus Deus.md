Mundus Deus is the name given to a jovian world with multiple wormholes that naturally occur within it that have caused anomalous climate systems due to the wind pump the wormholes have caused the world over time.  The millions of years of disruptive climate patterns came about from a phenomenon that is erratic- wormholes within the world siphoning the mass over millions of years.  The other side of the wormhole leads into inner branes where autonomous USOs kill anyone who enter.  It is known to be USO activity due to information that managed to return from the best defended vessel sent into the currents.  Not much else is known, but they are suspected to be miners from some other part of the universe or another dimension using Mundus Deus as a gas harvesting site.  Without further research we can only apply the most selfish motives to them.
