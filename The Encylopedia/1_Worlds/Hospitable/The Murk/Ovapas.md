## Ovapas

## Overview

Ovapas lacks rings but has a single sterile moon which orbits close, but lacks the size or tidal flux to have volcanism in more recent eras.  That explains the multiple layers of overlapping maria (the darker grey spots on worlds like the moon are “seas” of dried up lava flows called maria).  

Ovapas itself is a rapidly rotating ice giant, with six hour long days.  This had created a somewhat oblate world, with over 13 bands of wind that ended up becoming separate biomes that various clades of aeroplankton on a Ovapas have taken advantage of.  The Ovapian aeroplankton benefit from the rapid rotating, energetic world to the point they color the world itself all matter of elaborate colorations.  The more tropical regions have light blue and light pink aeroplankton from needing to reflect more sunlight while the polar regions tend to be of a dark purplish coloration to absorb more sunlight.  The temperate bands meanwhile have green chlorophyll producers akin to our own world’s plants.  

The life on Ovapas is maddeningly standard, with the expected floater flora and various ecologies which sprout off and around said floaters.  The elaborate eusociality of the Jovian ecology of hyperoxia (for another time) is pretty much absent.  There are however, sailers who get far more mileage out of the massive windspeeds and periodic mega storms which are endemic to a rapid rotating Jovian world such as Ovapas.  The massive temperature ranges and inconsistent light absorption of Ovapas has been an enigma for quite some time, with wide sweeping seasonal color changes seen from orbit being one of the reasons this world gets a lot of attention.
