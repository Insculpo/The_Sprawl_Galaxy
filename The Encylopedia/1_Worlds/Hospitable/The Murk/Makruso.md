## Overview

Makruso is an icy Terran world with a hydrogen rich atmosphere that has warmed it up enough to still be capable of life.  Makruso is orbited by two moons, both small but play a critical function in keeping the world warm.  Said life exists in a highly arctic environment with violet flora and a wide range of fauna thathave acclimated to the peculiar climate patterns and frigid seas of Makruso.  Makruso is a frigid Terran world, with its tropical region being a slush belt where the bulk of life exists while the polar regions are so cold as to be effectively uninhabitable for any known life, at least of carbon origin.  

The dangers of this world come from the crystallized rain storms and cold winds that weaken the integrity of your hull.  It also comes from some of the megafauna, of which managed to grow huge on this icy world.

The red skies of Makruso are a product of the world's distance and nitrogen poor atmosphere.
