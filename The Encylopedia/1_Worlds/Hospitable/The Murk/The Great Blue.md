The Great Blue is a very deep ocean world that is so deep it has packed ice-9 at the equatorial regions.  It is also extremely rich in phosphorus and geological activity that leads to vast underwater mountains.  It is a much deeper world than Maraternia and the gravity is high, so life does not dare even touch land and couldn't anyways.  Wave sides on the world get vast from the lingering disruptions of deep aquatic vulcanism.  

The greenish coloration of The Great Blue's organisms is not well understood, but is believed to in some way be copper related. But there is a coloration to depth on coloration, with deep sea organisms taking on dark blue colors laden in cupric bio minerals.  Indeed their bioluminescent bodies fill the night with lures, mating calls and territorial warnings that create an impressive light show. 

The deepest parts of the great blue are hard to reach as pressures get extremely crushing thanks to the very high gravity of the world, which almost would have doomed the world to becoming a full on steam world instead of merely a sauna world with copper rich peculiarities. 

The highest layer has sky organisms who use the electric properties of copper the most, mainly as a way of creating an organic form of hovering to act as an additional means to sky flying.  The Copperwings are the most commonly seen manifestation of this, ripping electric currents through and riding the vast waves of the ocean like dunes in a desert.  Copper wings do rest a lot, often just floating buoyantly with the flight state being used to migrate to find mates, evade predators or handle rocky waves.  They also have electrovoric properties, but not to the extent of an ammonia world organism.  Their brown-green coloration comes in from weathering of the bio minerals their bodies are composed of, but they do often shed such bio minerals leading the green detritus that further discolor parts of the world.
