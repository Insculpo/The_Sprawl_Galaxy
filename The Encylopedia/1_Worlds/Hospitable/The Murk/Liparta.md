Liparta is a Jovian world whose elaborate ring system has seen the development of a void ecology constrained to it.  This is a reoccurring form of biosphere that is usually the product of an icy moon with life being slowly shredded enough that life in the moon (mainly life in the shallow, frigid regions) manages to adapt to the shift in balance.  Often they stay microbial, but in more phosphorus rich ring systems this dynamic has a small chance of shifting to more elaborate, complex systems of life that bridge between the micro-meteors of the ring and expand out to the whole ring system, creating a ring based void ecology that is filled with free floating organisms who come to thrive in solar radiation and the van allen belt of the local Jovian world.  These creatures can grow to shocking sizes, some nearly a kilometer long.  They can complicate matters wherever they spring up, especially in the elaborate ring systems of Liparta where trying to mine from the rings is hard due to such activity attracting the attention of Lipartian megafauna.  

Lipartian life tends to have a biomineral rich complexion, with rough paste-like skin texture and spread out, hollow bodies which show little if any fluids being used-instead having a tarry substance.  They seemingly are lifeless but are shockingly active, with the ability to survive being shot apart only to have independent bodies continue to act on their original objectives like living, organic asteroids.  They also make use of sails and gases for a form of organic propulsion, but are mostly hibernating until they can ambush- often masking themselves as asteroids until something drifts too near before shooting out spikes to impale targets and dragging them in to be crushed.
