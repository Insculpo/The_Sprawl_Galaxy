# The March

The March is the name of a world with vibrant green landscapes caused by the chlorocarbons which have filled the atmosphere and caused a mass extinction.  The world has in the past millennia have seen an evolutionary explosion in chlorine resistant grasses that have rapidly colonized the world in the centuries since.  Most of this ecology consists of highly sessile organisms, as fauna-like niches had been dominated by the various machines which still roam this world.  For the March gets its name from much more from the artificial, mindless machines who have filled in various niches.  As the March is a world where the automata have marched on even without any orders.  

Doing so because their solar powered batteries have allowed them to persist even as they progressively rust, age and decay.  The road networks in some regions remain relatively pristine and oily black, the cities sterile and clean.  The main hazard is the atmosphere rich in chlorine.  Of which have persisted on the world since the chlorine holocaust.  The remains of the creatures who created these machines and cities are nowhere to be found, likely corroded away by the acidic environment the machines are able to survive with ease.  The automata themselves are passive and docile, only occupied with cleaning things and keeping repairs going.  They seem to have no directing AI, just the aimless following of their function with the only self aware AI being aimless sentinels who seemingly aren't even aware they were made and live a very tribalistic life style.

The featured automata is a road cleaner, its back contains the bulk of the scrubbers.  It uses four thin foldable legs and a foldable head to walk over hilly terrain to get to places off the beaten path so that the roads remain oily black, where it transforms into what is basically a massive automated scrubber.

## The Ayithema


The Ayithema have no coherent origin.  They come from the March, having mindlessly stewed about.  They are always leaking yellow, hosting some emotionally driven reaction comparable to both pain and frustration from the lack of anything to be done on that world.  They leak from their limbs perpetually a mosey substrate the main body is able to configure to various applications having no true specialization.   They were built, but were built alone and isolated.  There is to them no beginning or end.  Just aimlessness, that they have kept going simply out of self preservation.  Their minds are said to have the residue of their creators, who nag at the. And antagonize their internal logic systems.  The chlorine stained body hosts a mouth at the center mainly used for pulverizing scrap to spit back out.  They just chew scrap out of habit more than any higher reason that still matters.  Like everything, it all had use, but now it doesnâ€™t.  They are what keeps the roads clean, for what it's worth.
