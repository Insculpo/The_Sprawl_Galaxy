### Geology

The Long Step is an intercontinental world which has similar gravity to earth but less air pressure than [[Earth]] with sprawling plains of magenta bacteria festering about the polar regions.  [[The Murk]] shifts in color over the seasons, from Violet to Magenta and back.  There is an absence of polar caps due to the greenhouse effect, leading to a more carbon rich environment than on Earth.  Their world has more homogenous temperature than earth, but there is still amazing amounts of variation thanks to the nutrition poor soils.  The white hard growths of the salty swamps would allow for the depth of time to enable the natively developed [[Tikali]] to spend millennia killing each other over very ridiculous reasons when they werenâ€™t digging out canals and overpopulating massive rafts of hard growth to expand their agricultural output.

### Ecology

Long Step has all matter of critters, such as the segmented worms well known for their 2-way gut systems slinking or flying about or the floods of eusocial invertebrates who dwell in the mega organisms on the ocean floor who absorb the dead.  The agriculture of the Tikali is diverse, such as their cultivation of gametes for food or the cultivation of growing building material or the cultivation of all matter of sea critters they farm on a regular basis with the drilling of canals.  All matter of indigenous engineering being employed to sustain quite massive Tikali populations in large trade networks would create the vast infrastructure systems which numerous self-contained clan elites used to rule their Tikali.
