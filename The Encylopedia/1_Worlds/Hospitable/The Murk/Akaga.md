## Overview

 Akaga is an earth like world where there is only one kingdom of life.  The world has an ecosystem of chemotrophic creatures whose polyps take on a plant-like niche while the grasses are many tiny polyps of a similar nature.  The world is flooded in tiny flying insects who are the “spore” form of their world’s version of grass and are a critical element of most Akugan ecosystems.  These organisms make use of chlorophyll like earth organisms do, but often are much more yellow in their coloration due to their adult forms needing to absorb less sunlight.  It’s also an artifact of higher potassium quantities in Akagakaa’s lithosphere.  

 The world has around the same gravity as earth’s, but the air pressure is a bit weaker and this is why the world has darker colored skies than our own.  The weaker air pressure also contributes to life concentration in lower lying areas of the world than our own, as air pressure drops considerably sooner at higher elevation than on earth.  The world is heating up, so one sees many receding seas, more inclement weather and. Ore sea stacks in general.  Thankfully the life here is a bit more salt tolerant than earth life.
