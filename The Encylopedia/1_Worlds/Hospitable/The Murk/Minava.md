ï¿¼## Overview

This is a major [[Tikali]] world in the Mush.  It is a simmering realm and major civil center where all matter of activities are handled by the various clans taking residency throughout the city.  It is a world oft visited by humans and [[Natvyr]] but overwhelmingly Tikali.  Lots of advancement towards post biological formats has been experimented on in this world with various cybernetic tikallians, blank prospector mixtures and flux souls.  They are the blank prospector capital of the Mush to some degree, with blank prospectors sent to countless worlds in the Civic all charring their origin to Minava and its vast aquatic VR and machine forges.  They also have the darker side of being the center of various drowning ops whose actions in the Natvyr Hives and their infiltration of Sol are notorious in the present day and a sore point in human-Tikali relations.  

Indeed the simmering cities such as these are very dangerous due to how they use electric currents to create defenses in the atmosphere and all matter of water flow manipulation in heating/cooling regions of the world to induce currents favorable to them using the heat energy of the underwater cities themselves.  These Tikali clades are considerably more pressure resistant and so colonized Minava, a world lacking life to begin with, that more traditional raft cities are viewed as low class to the deep ones of Minava and their underwater tech cities.
