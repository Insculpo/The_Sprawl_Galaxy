The homeworld of the Phidians.  It is an extremely densely populated world and the core metropoles of [[Phidians]] activities exist here as the centralized counsulate which controls all of phidian existence carries on in their stable, pure existence.  The outer system is notable for having countless orbital RKMs with warp capabilities, to the point it is a dyson swarm full of such RKMs.  They are mostly static but if the system that the Consulate has consolidated ever were to break down, the orbital RKMs would be targeted at an extremely long list of worlds known to have life.  

**The Screaming Prospector Scandal**

In 2687 AD, there was a fly by of Phidius done by [[Prospect Space]] automata.  Such automata are known derisively as the 'screaming probes' due to how the Prospectors knew stealth was pointless against the Phidians and so opted to go the radical opposite strategy.  They would be a loud, obnoxious presence that ran through various Phidian sectors grabbing and pinging everything they could and transmitting it back to the greatest extent they could in the limited time given until being destroyed.  The screaming strategy was not flawless- it relied heavily on attrition and revealed significant degrees of Prospect Spacer capabilities to the Phidians.  

Only one probe managed to escape with the information and the reckless activities of such prospector probes has led to the Phidians being more paranoid than ever.  Still, a range of insights into the RKM complex that the Phidians have would become known.  Critics of the action complain it was reckless and archeoastronomy could have revealed more data, but the Prospect Spacers never were ones to be patient with data collection.
