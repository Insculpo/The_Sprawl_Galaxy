# The Vays




#### Kolosha

The kolosha are highly vicious beings in the nebulas of zeta Carina where they common as a drone swarm mind who are convinced they are gods.   The Kolosha conquered eta carina and have defended it aggressively ever since as a particularly nasty strand of the Vays.  These Vays have a matter stream oriented life span.  The Vays shift between solid and plasma near effortlessly through means which involve transmitted existence.   They basically have control over heat remotely, using quantum flu cations to pin temperature shifts at incredible precision sourced from the stars of eta carina rather parasitically.   The Kolosha are able to warp space time as well, making them FTL capable as well and they have migrated about the Galaxy over the millennia as a result and they only care for bright stars and so never cared for us.  It is hard to tell if they are truly sentient or what they are, they are believed to be of some origin, though unclear it is if it is extragalactic or from this Galaxy given the timelines they have been around.   Very dangerous ruffians either way, bring anti-matter or some means of sapping their energy and make sure to hit first as they will immolate your ship from within using an energy jolt.
