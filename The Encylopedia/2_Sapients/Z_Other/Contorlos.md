### Overview

Cortorlas is a many eyed Entity which has no real moral compass beyond its various set systems of action, not really intending to reproduce die of such, their whole motive is to be the sole observer, as they believe their existence is critical to the functionality of the cosmos on the grounds that if they didn't exist, their world which is one massive colonial Contorlas, would have crashed the universe long ago.  The Contorlas is self prescribed in a very fantastic cosmology which gave it the meaning of existence for practically free and sets itself as the cosmos- not merely the center of it.  It is a perverse entity, for it does like to play around with its visitors mostly out of sheer boredom even at the expense of their lives.  It seems to just see visitors as some thing which it manifested to begin with.
