### Overview

The Untir are strange entities found in the core region of the Galaxy, a advanced one at that.  They are notable for being made from heteropolies and alkaline metals.  They require extreme conditions such as, coming from a Chthonian world and thriving extremely close to stars, in environments that would make even the [[Vopson]] melt.  They evidently make use of magnetic relativistic propulsion and can live on the sunspots of dim stars with some protection.  Their burning world also had a "air stream" the Untirlons exploited to go to the stars.  Their world was a brown dwarf in a tight, but stable orbit and this intensity is what their kind is built on in regards to their dying F7 star.  The Untir are deeply xenophobic and hostile beings, they shoot on sight and are retardly hard to destroy by conventional means- use anti-matter or entropy devices if you want a chance.  

The Untir do not have consistent designs, as their modular biology allows them to transfer parts between individual kinds.  Their kind is evidently capable of star lifting and Dyson swarms, but are very sparing about the tech. They are more akin to a ecosystem than a species truth be told, but they do have markings of a vibrant state of existence somewhere within.  Tragically they refuse to trust what they cannot make part of them and have no desire to forcefully attempt to do so.  They also see the rest of Galaxy as the "frigid madness", low energy life being the norm has been of great dismay.  So they remain sheltered away and hostile from the Galaxy at large, not to mention their relative isolation means that they don't come into much contact with other species either way.
The Untirlonians are very distant beings, you only encounter them if you were to go thousands of light years coreward.
