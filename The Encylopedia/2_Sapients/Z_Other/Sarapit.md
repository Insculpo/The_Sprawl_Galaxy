### Overview

The Sarapit are primitive bipeds who exist on the fringes of the Galaxy as a very individualistic, but fluid formed sapient who have a very advanced Stone Age civilization which spans the world.  They lack metallurgy and so are perpetually limited by happenstance, even as they understood more it didn't help- their history is littered in hopeless attempts to get off their incredibly ancient, high gravity and metal poor world using laughably inane methods to absolutely no success.  Such histories play out depressingly common in the Galaxy- when an ambitious species never achieved space travel because they never had the resources even as they slowly understand the universe even in the face of darkness.  Many others just stay in the spiritual gram work and cosmovision, in ignorance- but the Sarapit were no such sapient.  They are devoutly atheist and have a math cult which has spent ages crunching through problems solvable by computers far quicker even as their information net works from plaster tablets remain ineffective at long term preservation.
