### Overview

The Salfluer are incredibly long legged creatures from a low gravity world and their main call to fame is their long legs being used for developing themselves a civilization.  The Salfluer had a civilization but lost it, their kind is ran by a technocratic elite and a world government which is totalitarian by nature and has been going on for millennia with breaks causing disasters and power struggles, still it always comes back to power on their petty little world.  They had attained industrialization multiple times- but have crash and burned every time over the millennia they have had industrial technology.
