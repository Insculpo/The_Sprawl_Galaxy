### Overview

The Polino are a cold blooded native species from a world with many volcanic islands in a shallow oceanic environment.  The Polino who are mainly known for their filter feeding habits and nocturnal life style being mixed with a high degree of self awareness, coordination and collectivism which communally spreads throughout their species.  Of which had created an unimaginable peacefulness within their species almost alien to the outside universe.  They have had some periods of conflict in the extreme circumstances their volcanoes occasionally have caused- but all of it ended after they figured out sailing.  With the advent of sailing, all violence just stopped for millennia to the point where none of their cultures used weaponry.  The Polino like to feed on aero plankton currents which spreads at night and have devised all matter of means which to capture, store and grow all matter of aero plankton on their world.  This allows them to live a pretty decent life style and never have they developed beyond such a form of life.  They had a total lack of pressures to- being the top predator on their world and having little internal conflict enabled this once volcanoes ceased being anymore than an inconvenience.
