### Overview

The Soplo are a peculiar species of yellow, stripped Stone Age sapients from the Centaurus Arm on the world of [[Sopliss]]
.  They are big, around the size of elephants and exist on a decent sized arid world with the humid polar regions where the forests thrive.  The Soplo are very much a nocturnal type, as they hibernate for much of the year due to rarely if ever leaving the northern polar region of their freakishly non-tilted world.
