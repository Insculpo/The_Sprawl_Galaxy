### Overview

The Illrop are a simple species from a simple world (that of [[Soto_4]] ), total simpletons.  What separates them from animal life is just one feature of free will which make them hard to ignore, and that is their tendency to solve math problems using inscriptions without much communication.  Their math symbols are but dots, therefore they are able to have written language.  Their math is simple and it seems to just be a way of showing pack dominance, but this seriously blurred lines for quite a few when they first came across them and found them had to interact with because they are very timid, very non- cooperative and seem to only like being around their group and treat outsiders as some dangerous stuff to avoid.  Still, they show many features of intelligence such as how their pack mentality is mixed with all matter of incredibly ornate ornamentation and their tendency to walk on top of each other to scale cliffs or get to food that even their elongated bodies couldnâ€™t normally access.
