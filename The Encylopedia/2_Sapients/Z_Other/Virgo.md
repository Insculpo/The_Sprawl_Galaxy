### Overview

The Virgo are a hyper advanced civilization, the most advanced in the known universe though it is arguable there is more.  The Virgo have been the rival species to that one probe from galaxies away and they evidently have remade whole galaxies we have yet to see in totally alien ways.  These Virgo have needless to say an agenda far greater than our pond puddle, and they are seen from time to time and there is handle any interest they have in us beyond their occasional spats with the sleepers.  They evidently have a hyperspace network which covers our galaxy and a base located in the thick disk, along with faculties in the core of the Galaxy they are constantly fighting with the bay groups over.  The sprawl seems to have been on good relations with them and the Virgo do not seem to have had any influence on their downfall, and evidently if they did they would be very open about destroying a whole galactic empire...  Which to them is like destroying some unruly tribe of natives.  The Virgo in general do not seem to take an active interest in our Galaxy, with the Sombrero Galaxy being the main locus of their activity instead due to its massive, massive black hole.  Andromeda evidently as well.
