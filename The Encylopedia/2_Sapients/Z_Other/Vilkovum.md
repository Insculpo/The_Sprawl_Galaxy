### Overview

The Vilkovum is are beings whose rigid, deep green appearance is sanctioned by a whirling grace and cities of inverted pyramids..  They are located on the archipelago world of [[Viklu]].
.   The Vikovum are large, 9' tall and with a 13' wing span, they are however very light weight creatures who aren't very social- many inverted pyramids are actually made for close knit groups and with the intent to store food they hunted and protect against other Viks.  The Vikovum are still a Stone Age society, and they are very niche, with an incredible fear of the ground and regionally limited to one part of [[Viklu]].  The Vilkovum are a dying species, mainly due to their forests dying off from microscopic fungi culling their trees and intensifying storms.  The Vilkovum serve to many as a reminder that advancement is not inevitable and not even common.  The Vilkovum have brought about much of this on themselves for the microscopic fungi that now destroys their world was used mainly in a form of bio-jewel work known as sap embedding with the sap dragging this fungus all over their forests at populations it never would have if they just didn't use the sap.
