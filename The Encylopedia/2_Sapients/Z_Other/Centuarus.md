### Overview

Centuarus entities are the most advanced known beings in our universe.  No interactions, just background noise unlike the Virgo who seem a lot more aware of them.  The Centuarus Entities are evidently some sort of post material beings, the ones often imaged but never seen.  It is unknown if they had any bearing on our part of the universe or even how they affect other parts of the universe.  They make the custodians seem like microbes, that much is certain.  Why?  For they are simply able to warp and contort the very laws of physics when needed and make a hobby of reshaping galaxies artistically.  Such acts of beauty are out of reach and too recent in our corner to be seen however.  The details of their truly immense civilization are however, greatly unknown.  Only that they are symbolized by a dual helix specter of some blue material. Ingin is of Centuarus origin and evidently the Centuarus have become something beyond civilization, where they donâ€™t have states as we think of them.  [Ingin]() even, is unclear on if it is an individual, a collective or a whole civilization in of itself.  And ignin is but a speck of what the Centuarus are.
