### Overview

The sodov are a skittish species found mainly within multiple rotating cylinders on the fringes of the galaxy who are suspected to be a  lost client of some ancient society and who the custodians have a weird relationship with.  They're quite common, thousands of these cylinders exist with no connectivity between each other beyond the occasional custodian transport.  Yet for all their variation, there are many commonalities.  For instance, they all come from artificial "wombs" from the great womb at the core of their world, which they pretty much defend at all costs, to the point of mass suicide.  They tend to be extremely quick in their calculations, and have worldviews which prefer quick answers.  

Some of these nomadic Sodov have invaded other worlds for resources and for the sake of invasion- the sensation of invasion- but that isn't a universal as many are much more isolationist and hostile to the outside universe.  They are notable to humans mainly due to how they physically are humanoid, despite their radiowave oriented media of vision but they have psychologically proven incredibly alien, to the point where aliens such as an [[Utanguis]], [[Tikali]] or even a [[Fosskemian]] are considered much more relatable despite having more exotic forms and psychological quirks that alter an otherwise "humanesque" psychology.  

### Psychology

To elaborate, the Sodov don't think in terms of subjects at all, it's all just a slur of sensational stimuli with no abstraction attached with a collective impulsiveness which breaks any idea that they think as individuals as there is never disagreement over issues, and not even out of forces to conform, they just don't disagree and instead act of census and census alone.  They are extremely math oriented in everything, to the point where their languages look more like sets of elaborate math equations than patterns of logic associations.  This may make them seem intelligent, but actual logic is incredibly broken for there are no math problems being solved by their numerical language, in fact a huge part of their language is making errors to communicate different sensations of attack, pause, look, shift and absorb.
