### Overview

The Okar are filter feeders from an icy world known as [[Okaria]] towards the center of the galaxy, living through filtration of the radiation flux and building strings of radiation absorbing quasi-flora in the salt barrier zone 12 km below the surface.  They're a very slow thinking species, methodically building their global system and social patchwork, they view themselves as the weavers entrusted to chain the monsters of the abyss to the depths using their radiation farms.     They don't believe they have succeeded at this much because their chains decay too fast, so the efforts on their part are practically endless but they simply lack the resources to hold it up.  So predation issues continue for them.  The issues simply stack up for them as they can't communicate well and their society has been rather feudalistic for quite some time.  Endless feuding, frustration and stress pretty much defines their existence.  They hate working, but they must, or else they get devoured by the world underneath them.  Or so their myth goes (in all the truths it holds; there really are more busters who prey on them and building their nets keeps them less likely to predate upwards due to an aversion to radiation absorb any flora despite devouring creators who live off the radiation absorbent flora.

The Okarian ecology is built upon the lattice weed, which in the wild is limited, but with Okar cultivation has become a global network of flora that the Okar have evidently been cultivating for over fifty thousand years as one of the first sapient uplifts.  The Okarian civilization is incredibly complicated, it has survived a couple impact incidents and integrates many cyrophiliac fauna like themselves.  The lattice weed's vast nutrition network has been mostly fed by surface radiation.  They just know something in the great barrier fuels them, they have tried to find out what at times, but the stress of having to keep the networks maintained over the millennia has made a communal culture where such inquiry is rare at best.  And since no one survived leaving, they assume it's like throwing people into volcanos.

Exploring the depths has been attempted, but again it is too terrifying to them.  The depths horrify them so much they have to see lattice weed in view or it's like being lost to eternity and inevitably being devoured by the deep ones.  Indeed the deep ones have truth to them, mega fauna does exist which prey on fauna that get dragged down by the convection currents.  Indeed it's these convection currents the lattice seems to exist to counter act and allow for a large Okarian civilization.  It's very communally managed, with the managers being known as the Conduits who have been in power for at least ten thousand years after the cutting catastrophes.  The earlier eras didn't have as stable networks, the violence makers of those times made life hard for all and their refusal to connect all the nets like it started to be in the last twenty thousand years.
