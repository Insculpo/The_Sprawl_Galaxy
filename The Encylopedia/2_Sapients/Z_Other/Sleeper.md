### Overview

Believed to have been a rather advanced society perhaps on the level of the Mjazzans when they existed (which evidently was contemporary with the Zarathuta and the Empire of Zirtrix), the Sleepers had a deeply interwoven whose cast but scattered ruins can be found in remote parts of the Galaxy.  The modern Sleepers are much, much more advanced.  The modern Sleepers manifest as orbs a few meters in size and these orbs are incredibly powerful, having become completely reactionless in their motion and insanely resilient- a combination that makes it very easy for them to use their own vessels as projectiles when their micro-fleets of interception craft are not enough.

The Ancient Sleepers were a civilization that had purged the galaxy of the Gardeners and basically were the sole galactic power for quite a few millennia until their kind, for reasons still unknown went into mass hibernation.  As this happened, the early iterations of what the modern orb sleepers are around 700 kya started to go about the galaxy placing warp drive cores all over the place.  To this day, these orb sleepers continue down this path.
The Sleepers do not have their organic forms anymore, just these post-material entity forms that interact with our reality either in incredibly strange 200 Km in size city worlds or in the nomadic orbs that flow about the galaxy.  The Sleepers continue to defy all logic, and their motives just are not known.  Only their actions.

Sleeper Drive Cores are incredibly crude compared to what the Sleepers themselves use, made to be easy for upstart civilizations to reverse engineer and use.  These drives are all over the galaxy, each star system has dozens of them often in the outer systems and often can be used as easily plugged in black boxes.  This has made the drive cores a common commodity to civilizations who never bothered to reverse engineer them and make a more advanced system, which if one doesn’t do leads to great stagnation.

The Sleepers very, very rarely intervene in the affairs of interstellar civilizations, with the one known documented case being their killing of Zirtrix and even that was a snap reaction to Zirtrix seeking the destruction of the Sleepers in order to make their own galactic order and actually attacking Sleepers.  The Sleepers are small in number, it is estimated only a few million exist in the whole galaxy and their worlds are even more rare, evidently dismantled by the orbs in large numbers once the hibernation began.

### Sleeper Orbs

Sleeper orbs are 3-5 meters in radius and tend to be hard to see beyond their infrared heat readings.  The Sleepers Orbs tend to have fleets of small, centimers sized ships that defend them and intercept attacks along with advanced shielding systems to stave of lasers.  Sleeper technologies are very focused on being able to make use of waves, to the point that they have made reactionless drives and an incredibly sophisticated FTL system.  It is unclear if the orbs are part of a super organism, an individual or a whole civilization each.  The Sleepers are also able to make their crude warp systems on the spot and have by this point made over a trillion of them across the galaxy, though the distribution is highly irregular thanks to the tendancy of some civilizations to hoard the warp systems under the impression they can’t make them themselves.  The Zarathustra being the most notorious example.
