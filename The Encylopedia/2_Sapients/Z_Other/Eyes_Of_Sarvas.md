### Overview

The eyes of Sarvas are a massive colonial being who exist on a high gravity world lining a mountain of dead creatures with these eyes as a highly centralizing brain for the whole moon system which orbits the world of Sarvas.  The moons being clients of Sarvas, perpetually from the total monopoly on space travel Sarvas has held for millennia- it is a fact of life that Sarvas is the sole genius of the system and destroys all who challenge it with all matter of deadly chemicals, diseases and bombardments.  Those who are at the mercy of the Sarvas go about a rather impartial life, in their own petty quarrels and power struggles for what Sarvas has no interest in- indeed it would seem Sarvas is a god to these post tribals, who may well have made Sarvas, but whether or not that matters are of little relevance to the local authorities who know what matters is Sarvas has the power and they do not.  Lucky for them, Sarvas is content just to monopolize and nothing more as it spends the bulk of its time doing unspeakably strange activities on Sarvas itself, such as arrangement off the biosphere into a colorful patchwork on very artificial lines built from the ruins of whatever civilization it emerged from.
