### Overview

The Loptras are a tribal societies stuck in the Stone Age who live on the world of [[Zeem]], which is a very dense world on the whole and has water which is toxic to us due to its high metal content (being rich in aluminum and such, though not nearly to the extremes of say, [[Varpossos]]). Zeem is a hotter world as well, and so life here is cold blooded and generally adapted to this sort of heat and the Loptra species is of no exception as they continue their existence as subsistence dwellers with cave towns and aqueducts in the most advanced regions and empires.  They haven't advanced beyond the Stone Age and likely never will due to not having good sources for metal to begin with beyond copper and so they live a existence enriched primarily by their biosphere and Father Time, for they do not consume much and so never run out of food to begin with which is why they are a rather frugal, low conflict species as a whole despite some disputes and regional border conflicts in the more resource strapped regions.
