# Fractal Folk

## Overview
ï¿¼
The Fractal Folk are a breed of beings whose origins remain deeply enigmatic, even as known products of the [[Phidians]] for they seem to be sessile creatures with a role inside the Phidias forces as a companion for a whole contingent of Phidians in a role comparable to that of both a mascot and a miracle worker.  The fractal Folk don't seem to have individuality or any decision making independent of their groups, but do show to be clearly living beings. .  Fractal Folk seem to have a general multi-state mode of existence, usually. Sing most active around Phidians and most willing to spread some of their fractals to them.  Fractal spreading for fractal Folk is essentially a branding process for their kind, who cultivate off being give attention and die when left alone and in neglect.  Even more so than with humans.  Fractal Folk essentially exist only if they sense they  are appreciated and die when they are ignored.  They can't exist in a lonely state.  They just can't, they literally can't.
