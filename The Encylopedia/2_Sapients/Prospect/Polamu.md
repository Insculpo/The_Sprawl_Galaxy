# Polamu

The polamu are a machine used by the [[Fosskemian]] sapients and [[The Conductors]] primarily for maintaining their stuff and maintaining their supplies.  They're standard service droids basically, making use of numerous robust nanostrings which to reshape their appendages for whatever function they are being called upon to perform.  The polamu's versatility is best seen in how they usually work both as defense systems and cleaning systems, without any regulation on this as it is a common civilian fixture.  The polamu have found themselves in the possession of numerous species mainly due to how cheap and effective their distinctive hover nanite manipulation system is at adapting to all sorts of gear and tools it is handed no matter what species it came from.
