### Overview

The Snoflolos are creatures from icy worlds who had achieved interstellar travel without FTL by simply drifting between planemos for thousands of years.  They are arachnid-like critters who come from worlds with seas of liquid helium and are extremely alien for that reason alone; their whole biochemistry is unique.  Snoflolos move extremely slowly and have adapted to living off cyrovulcanism.  Their sapience is a massive fluke; their ice world is a large world with liquid nitrogen volcanoes, but it also was a world packed with methane ices and stone deposits from asteroid strikes.  The gel globs which pervade the world organically made the building materials the Snoflolos use for effectively everything.  

The Snoflolos spent millennia in interstellar space establishing about on various worlds and were deeply disrupted by the Cyrawaloc during the Dominion Era.  The Snofolos went to war with the Cyrawaloc for ten years until submission due to simply lacking FTL and the Cyrawaloc conquerors warp-bombing a world of theirs in interstellar space.  The Snoflolos, while not stupid never were adapted to the cunning speeds of the Cyrawaloc and only remain independent due to being widespread across many lifeless planemos.  In more recent times they have creeped back with their ice castles and outer-star system emphasis but have had a hard time making FTL systems without Glinnvyr dependance.  The Snoflolos are used as tools for volatile (icy resources) mining primarily.  The Snoflolos independents are still running away from the Cyrawaloc, never touching any planet out of paranoia of the Cyrawaloc.
