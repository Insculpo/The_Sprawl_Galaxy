### Overview

Illapians  exist as block-like entities on a high gravity world, and they are very much oriented around a seeming mindless way of societal development with their two large prehensile sensory tendrils and their nature has allowed them to not really advance much at all.  They simply dominate their one world as a primitive which naturally developed in a ancient megastructures ordained by the builders and so always knew wormhole travel- having traveled across all of it in mass migrations and having developed thanks to all the examples around them.  The Ramuu beat them to advancement, though that doesn't concern them at all due to their insularity and callousness about innovation and a values system oriented around anti-materialism which is incredibly terrible for development.  They are survivors and that is what matters to them.
