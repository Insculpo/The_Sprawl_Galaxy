# Scramblers

Scramblers are Prospect Space local holographic digital beings who scramble apart many signals as they consume energy from data streams, as a sort of information parasite for they mimic and manipulate information flows to get more data flow to consume, to the point where they are incredibly specialized to data consumption, especially due to their "metabolism" being data oriented- having to reduce data to energy to actually use it, while imprinting parts of it into themselves to modify their behavior and intelligence.
