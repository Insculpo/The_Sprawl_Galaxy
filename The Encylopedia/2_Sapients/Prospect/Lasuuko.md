### Overview

The Lasuuko are alien beings who live prominently on deeply tropical worlds with a radial symmetry.  The Lasuuko are starfish shaped and have five limbs that can all double as heads when needed, with a detachable gut at the center of their body.  The Lasuuko are found mostly in the company of [[Vopson]] as the Vopson view the Lasuuko as a crop to cultivate.  

The Lasuuko ironically would thanks to the Vopson, come to inhabit many worlds since the Vopson needed incubator worlds for them and the Vopson had a tendancy to use Lasuuko in military invasions under the promise of getting a new colony in exchange for their services.  The Lasuuko evidently aren’t bothered by how their populations get periodically harvested as they don’t really know anything else and were a bronze age society at best when the Vopson invaded their world.

The [[Vopson]] found use of the Lasuuko as mercenary armies against other oxygen breathing species whenever they got in the way, most notably with the Golden Swarm and humans as a way to mock humans by infesting human colony worlds with Lasuuko during the start of their planetary invasions to cause chaos and make the larger swarms able to crush resistance much more rapidly.

The Lasuuko elsewhere in the galaxy have managed to become a space faring society on one world, said world was slugged by the Vopson, but that systemic depopulation of a highly urbanized planet simply too little too late as by that time the Lasuuko of that world had enough stolen Glowing Swarm technology to escape to the stars.  However most Lasuuko remain in the talons of the Vopson and the Lasuuko are a species humans encountered during the Golden Swarm’s invasion in combat roles.  A Lasuuko diasporia has emerged in human dominated space after the shattering of the Golden Swarm.
