In the harmonious aggregations of the metasyndicate there is a need to keep the agent, balances, conglomerates and unraveling units in symphonic harmony.  They are never on the same page in practice, as the point with them is to play out scenarios that min max the need for harmony and company encoded into the composers for all the entropy occultism that goes on in the [[Metasyndicate]].  The conductors are usually described as bulk, hulking machines with nanofibre strands emanating from their photonic computers and humming with constant simulation from continuous perception of everything around it.  They're finicky as a result, usually having other agents and strand machines (or [[Polamu]]) as an entourage.  The conductors have some independence from the actual composers to an extent, but their personalities are projected from the composers directly and so usually refer to themselves in a fashion such as "IPPA's Conductor".  They often oversee negotiations between the interest groups within the Metasyndicate and intervene as needed, they also are what you talk to if a composer summons you on a planet and want a physical presence for whatever arbitrary reason (they use holographic tech otherwise).  They are directly connected to the [[Composer]] entities.
