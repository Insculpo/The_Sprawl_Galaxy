# The Cancer

## Overview

The cancer was the great nightmare- once used by the dominion as something it used to hold countless worlds hostage to ensure domination of all known life.

Yet even with the impossible danger the cancer promised, the Dominion found itself dealing with rebellion and insurgency regardless.

They kept threatening it, but their hesitance to use it ended up making the dominion seem like they were bluffing.

It was insane to think such a thing was even possible, the tests were well hidden and the secretiveness on the project was beyond totalitarian- the Dominion has no problems regimenting mind purging to keep secrecy (they used mind purging quite liberally, even if it's a bit hard when trillions may work against you at once and you have no certainty who to go after)

Yet it existed.

It started innocently- a project to accelerate terraforming of worlds by automating the colonization process with a synthetic ecology that could accommodate as many different species as possible in the greater unified biology project the Dominion had for a time sought after.  

These projects enabled the bilethought as it is often called- the realization this same tech just as easily is altered to make a weapon that can render entire galaxies uninhabitab;e.  The ultimate grey goo catastrophe.

And this is what made the cancer unique- the cancer allowed them to perpetually absorb and meld minds to them, act as a vessel for immortality.  For absolute stability.

Shame the consciousness of the cancer lacked the capability to actually do this as the ivoltic efforts in theory could.  Indeed it was more like one suffered slowly and without recourse as the consciousness got subsumed by the infantile idiocy of the being itself.

The cancer is meant to be hard to get rid of- by nature it absorbs lithotrophic energy sources along with the biomatter of living beings on the target world.  It's a hungry one.  Always consuming.  Always.

And so when Vinlinder released it, it was reality shattering.  Hundreds of worlds were salted with the cancer at once for defying once more after the ultimatums that they assumed they would never follow on- quite a few thought even if they had such weapon they'd never actually use it as genocide was so taboo to begin with.

The Dominion collapsed anyways, the horror show of the cancer caused their insurrection problem to blossom to cosmic proportions.  Than came the centuries of chaos between the collapse of the dominion and the Custodian invasion.

The Custodian Invasion's legacy being that cancer became quite widespread with organized forces curbing it appearing "too late" to stop its spread without purging entire worlds.  The [[Custodians]] may or may not have invaded over the cancer or just a desire to kick a rival society while it was down.  

Talking to the cancer is always fine, it consciously sees no connection to its actions and behavior like a lot of mega organisms fail to.  It lacks true self awareness as is.

## Properties of the Cancer

- The Cancer isn't actually as it seems, it's a synthetically made weapon that uses iterative behavior to rapidly integrate resources to itself to spread and xenoform a world to oblivion.
- They were made with the existence of machines in mind, with electromagnetic pulses being frequenly spewed by a lot of their organisms along with using tiny organisms to flood break/subterfuge processors.
- It often creates regional chlorine gas infested hellscapes when not saturating the world in a wide range of deadly chemicals through organic structures it grows for the purpose of polluting the world.
- They make use of biomineral batteries in place breathing, which is used to xenoform intentionally.
- It actively taints the oceans as well.  
- All of this is made adaptable, able to afflict a wide range of solvents and environmental conditions with different cancer clades evolving to deal with all the major world types the dominion came across of.
- It doesn't actually consume organic matter, but still encapsulates and smothers it anyways.
- Among the various organisms of the cancer mind includes swarm spreading walking hives of suicidal nanite clouds.  
- Along with all matter of other larger suicidal flying, swimming and walking organisms that spread tumorous growths and spores.  
- And an ecology of less deadly organisms who passively fester to spread toxins all over the world to make it uninhabitable.  These organisms vary in danger and often shift forms to adapt to the gravity well and air pressure of a planet.  
- Finally, the cancer has another component; its seeds that it can spread wherever it goes, including microgravity and was made to rapidly spread through spacecraft.  

For all this, the cancer in practice proves to not be the existential danger it was first thought of.  Instead it's a festering force, that spreads only if neglected.  Direct purifying is easy enough, but there's actors like the Bilethought who actively spread it.  And there's worlds still colonized with cancer on it, harvesting the biominerals of the cancer.  Such cancer worlds can be extremely lucrative and dangerous since the risk of spreading the cancer is a constant that had forced a lot of life to life in artificial worlds.  Mind, even artificial worlds aren't safe either, simply easier to control access to...
