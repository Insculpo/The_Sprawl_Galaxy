### Overview

The Vilate are a composite sapient like the [[Utanguis]].  However, the Vilate are distinct from the Cyrawaloc in that the Vilate have no sapience unless both species are present in them.  Those two species are the Swarmer and the Vine.  The Vine is a plant with many flowers and neural tubes which connects together to make a moving, creeping mega-flower that is very attracted to bright sources.  The swarmerâ€™s within make multiple hives and act as both a connecting unit and a defense system, along with a complicated genetic modification system where swarmer take on many specialized forms that the Utanguis have devised.  

The Vilate typically follow feudal social norms and had a weak space faring society that never developed FTL (for their star was a dim M2) that would eventually by conquered by the Cobalt 5000 years ago.  The Vilate nobility live in ships monitoring and handling space affairs while the commoners live in a very happy existence modifying the ecosystems of their home world in great acts of aesthetic expression. Biosphere scale art is their expertise, as is developing bioplagues.  The Vilate are a common client species in multiple factions where the [[Dozinism]] as a faith is dominant.
