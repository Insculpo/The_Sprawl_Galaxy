### Evolution 

The Sarkic come from a large, stormy world where sight is not advantageous.  Electric communication ended up being widespread on the world, with an atmospheric media where electric currents flow clearly despite the damp appearance.  The Sarkic developed to understand millions of different electric "signals", 'sensing' the information contained within the electric media.  The Sarkic world has led to all manner of strange creatures by Earthly standards, mainly in the proliferation of electric beings and colonial bacterial clouds that make lightning to disperse waste heat.  These weather ecosystems, made of various chemical fugues of vortices seem to have directed evolution to some unintended degree on their world, at least in making life forms that better absorb the energy they zap down to the surface to create a weather cycle evidently beneficial to them.  The Sarkic may be objective in their belief of god-clouds, in the sense that they do hear clouds “speak” even if said cloud speech is total gibberish- this hasn’t stopped the Sarkic from interpreting it in special coded languages.  They just seem to go about spreading, absorbing light and zapping the ground.  However, it is not like humans have any way of communicating with such an alien entity as living clouds on a thick stormy world, if there even is such a thing.  Evolution on their world is a mess either way.

### Biology

The Sarkic are beings that base themselves around electronic networks and being able to absorb and generate lightning/energy.  They do not speak and don’t need to as they have body language and thrashing to sound alarms along with loud buzzing when freaked out.  Electric currents are how they normally speak, and this means that speak and 'think' in a way more based around currents than neural connections.  Their thought and speech are one in the same and conveyed speech on different channels to different individuals or relating speech from others is very easy for them without tech.  The Sarkic are radially symmetrical beings with a square-like body plan with four limbs.  Their four limbs are used more to knock themselves around, being very light creatures they float partially from the ground with limbs that grip/roll for absorbing food somewhat like a sun pitcher plant.  Male Sarkic have a "sex arm" that is basically like a massive penis in functionality.  Females simply wrap arms and start generating capsules soon after.

The Sarkic are grazers living off various resources from the sky and the ground and migrating to wherever electrical storms are occurring.  Speech can drain them if they talk too long, and so the Sarkic speak very directly and try to limit the time it takes to convey data.  They are frequently in need of lightning storms that they want to be struck by.  Sarkic can conduct electricity to feed each other, so speaking acts as nourishment to a Sarkic.  

### Psychology

Sarkic individuals are hard to come by since they tend to share a outside name (but have a personal name internally) as the network they are part of.  Kazzlehorf "ethnicity" is more discriminated by what networks they have better 'flow' with than anything else- there is various 'flow' minds within a network that associate with each other and collaborate, or backstab to unify collectively with extreme instances leading to a single super mind.  It all depends.  The Sarkic being space faring is in many regards a fluke caused by the disruptions the Fosskemians caused to the planet wide network leading to massive innovations in the span of a century.  They were rather advanced beforehand, having progressively developed over the millennia to make massive world spanning civilization whose complacency would be shaken when their clouded world was penetrated by beings from the sky. It is safe to say that loneliness is something felt around the Galaxy, as while a Sarkic alone can think independently, the Sarkic prefer being within a network of Sarkic they are in some level of communication with due to the collective nourishment the Sarkic live by.

### Culture

The Sarkic are extremely hard to gleam since they do not write much, instead transfering information to each other in their electric currents in a "hard telepathy" as some describe it.  They speak with imagery, words and often are very disconnected from their surroundings in a group since only one Sarkic is all you need to send a collective disturbance through a group to get out of there.  Sarkici groups tend to number in the thousands naturally and potentially billions thanks to force amplifying technology that can make planetary communications.  In practice because communication delays make it hard to create massive planet wide networks, sub-ecological minds usually appear and conformity is not as universal as it may seem to an outsider.  Information based warfare to unify minds is how the Sarkic usually go to war, with each other that is.  The Sarkic shout to death outsiders that disturb them.  The Sarkic can perceive the world around them just fine, and Sarkicii individual entities tend to specialize themselves in the interests of their network to certain roles, often artistic in nature.  Sarkic art tends to be glass and metal in construction material, making elaborate sculptures that to humans seem to be like mountains of melted glass and rubber but hold the information for epics and poems.  One example being the [[Vacuum Mountain Manuscript]], which pertains to the nature of energy and our thirst for warmth of even hostile worlds in a cold, dying universe.

### Technology

Sarkic innovations can appear sudden due to their many minds digesting information diffused to them from the more advanced societies they have met, adapting some of their mental traits in the process.  Most notorious is their plasma revolution when they figured out how to make plasma based rockets, plasma barriers, plasma "speakers" and so on in rapid .  The Sarkic treat their tech as if it is living, which is true if you consider Quasi-Intelligent conduits alive.  Their wiring systems are ironically carbon based as silicon based wiring systems keep breaking on them.  Oil is an important commodity to the Sarkic, mainly in the manufacture of graphene wiring and rubber alloys.  The “Rubber” alloys are a metamaterial based off rubber that is used to shield against micrometers.
