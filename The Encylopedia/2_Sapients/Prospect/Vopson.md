### Biology

The Vopson are flying, flock-minded alien beings who are only sapient when mating as a fluke in their evolution caused neural connectivity to occur between individuals during sex.  This has less to do with a psychic connection and more to do with their mating being akin to some species of worms on [[Earth]]; they bind together for hours on end, often days or even weeks.  During sex, their pheromone release is far greater and their influence on others of their kind is extremely strong.  Information transfer happens both by pheromone and speech, though space and countering ‘exploiters’ has limited their ability to speak traditionally much to the contempt of Vopson across the galaxy.  The Vopson are extremely numerous despite coming from a world with oceans of sulfuric acid and having developed technology derived from very developed pottery (for instance, they have a very light weight breed of pottery that is very coveted), orgasmic computing and the plastic flesh of local megafauna to get off world.  The Vopson are unique in being a space faring species from a world where technological civilization was thought impossible due to the acids corroding metals.  

The Vopson in truth got lucky, for they happened to have giant life forms with skeletal structures that could be moldable into spacecraft on their world of [[Fuedisar]] which the Vopson farm on a regular basis for all matter of applications in massive numbers.  Whole continents can be devoted to farming billions of the giants, it’s important for their technological civilization after all.  Their chemical computing systems and sophisticated ceramics along with chemical rockets (they still have free oxygen in their atmosphere) allowed them to begin colonizing other worlds.  The Vopson have asymmetrical relationships with other species in the galaxy due to being able to live on worlds inhospitable to most other life forms and have been found among mega corporations like the notorious Platinum Unit.  Vopson tend to aggregate in super personalities that define massive ‘swarms’ which flow about space in a shared common culture/mentality.  Vopson at times will isolate whole flock minds in order to avoid being assimilated by these hordes.

The Vopson are a sapient flying species with multiple consciousness’s that converge, this is like a much more sophisticated form of the bird flocks on [[Earth]].  They can act individually, but are inclined far more to collective action within their flock.

### Culture

That is not to say the Vopson are incapable of non-conformity, if they were than they wouldn't be a technological civilization.  The Vopson are a very collective learning species, and can think tank incredibly well.  Their way of speaking so happens to also mean chemistry is more intuitive for them than us.  This means the Vopson simply are effective at chemical use, developing an array of advanced, chemically derieved products that from our perspective are basically alchemical in nature.  Two major examples are Therma-Plastics and Pressure Acids.  Therma-plastics are essentially plastics that withstand insane amounts of heat while pressure acids are highly acids metamaterial liquid which harden on impact exponentially.  Pressure acids are frequently used as weapons and gauges in their hardware systems.  Later developments once they became space faring (with Orgasmic computing based FTL systems) also would occur.  Such as the use of Fiber-Optics and germanium based electronics by the Glowing Swarm.
The Vopson have gained a strong tendency to model asteroids into spacecraft, which they can make massive fleets from.  These asteroid spaceships come in massive numbers, are huge and can house millions of vopson each.  Thousands of asteroids warp into a star system and they launch many smaller swarm ships that simply devastate the local system, like millions of missiles.

### Vopson Naming

Flock Name only; all Vopson affiliated with the flock, the internal sub-conscious identification means names are self-given and mutate with their personalities.  Three swarms with flock names are shown here are examples from sub-flocks of three of the major swarms.  The swarms have flocks within them, the difference being the degree of conformity in mind and collective fetishism they have with each other.
