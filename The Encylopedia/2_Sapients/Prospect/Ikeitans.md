The multi-layered Existence of an ikeitan has continued to breed a world of their own in the void they had fled to with the cooperation of those who chose their ikeitian comradery over the corrupted judgement of the eternal avatar.  The nomadic fleets had developed antidozinism because the ikeitans who had dozinist loyalties let themselves die because [[Dozin]] so willed it.  The ideal of destroying Dozin came about as a radicalization from the chaos of the warlords who continued to harass them and the cancer spreading- of which was also done under dozin's evident judgement.  The crisis of faith was bad for even devout dozinists, let alone the ikeitans who would end up with the Urzine fleet ascendant due to their combined fleet methods and use of wisdom ideation to attract a broad coalition of beings who wanted new leadership and new values after dozin's atrocities alienated so many.  They came to find themselves entranced by the vengeful desire of a war against Dozin.  To destroy the god that tried to destroy them- and stop the Dozinists from bringing Dozin into full existence seeing the subservience demanded of it.  To worship Dozin, to cede the self.  The [[Urzine Domain]] fleet culture spread virally.  

The ikeitans might be a little mentally unstable but that's just how they are now.  Ikeitan crews and vessels are a mix, some are more follower escorts others directly are in and stationed within the ikeitan as task managers and dutiful crews.  

An ikeitan does not directly speak with the rest of the group.  Their communication is mostly through proxy members and such.  An ikeitan doesn't even have a symbiotic pilot, instead one finds computer-like mainframes woven into the body.  It's a very intracite system and the access to the central mind.  The ikeitan does at times directly speak to a crew member, but it often is about things they can't even begin to understand.  It just is a question of thought.  The crew mostly feels the presence around them but it is pretty ambient, however overwhelming the pulsing of the organic curvatures and walls can get.  The upper and lower regions of the habitable cavity are places the crew lives, with microgravity regions and such within the middle chambers and various inertial latches when high g-force maneuvering happens, which is common enough the crew is augmented to handle such force gradients.  

**Reproduction**

The antidozinist was built in iterative growths, from the early phase polyp entities that were further augmented and helped by pilots (polyp ikeitans have pilot helpers as an aide, but more matured ikeitans have no need for them).  The ikeitan life cycle is not a cycle per say as the reproductive vector is one of a void ecology organ that gestates the ikeitan polyp more than of direct copulation.  The womb installations are closely guarded by multiple layers of secrecy, they aren't even known and cover stories for how it is all done for the selecting process on what genetics to combine and bioengineer are given countless false stories, some made intentionally as absurd as possible or otherwise made to make whoever speaks them sound like a deranged, depraved nutcase.    This hasn't stopped some of the biometallics from getting reverse engineered or process methods stolen for other purposes by infiltrators.  

However the antidozinist mindset is one of ignition.  They aren't inherently distrusting, if anything they're obnoxious in how obsessive their misothiesm can get- especially the younger ikeitans needing to prove their power and loyalty to the elder ikeitans.  Some of the elder ikeitans are more jaded about the Dozin conflict, even with the weapons programs the ikeitans have put tons of research and development into in order to defeat Dozin and the "waking of Dozin" they believe will mean something that makes the cancer xenoforming weapons look as little botched science projects the polyps and the incompetent pilot that enables them carry out on asteroids. 

**Ikeitan Generations**

Gestational - Ikeitans early on gestate within the ecological installations.  They break themselves and try to figure out which ones are the best, reforming and metamorphically altering in shape as they percolate into the unified polyp form.  The gestating process is very strange in its rapid adversarial patterning.  Shark gestation is a lose analog but it undersells the kind of adversarial cooperation at play.  It foreshadows the rest of their life.

Juvenile - Juvenile ikeitans are young ikeitans that are numerous but often dependent on a pilot and usually not allowed to engage in deployments to the extent adult ikeitans are.  The effectiveness of juveniles is less, but even a juvenile ikeitan is a match against most spacecraft in prospect space.  To say the least of the more advanced, layered and wise vessels in the near-gerontocracy that the ikeitans have going on.

Adult - Ikeitans can produce gametes that get fed to the gestational ecologies as needed, ikeitan gender is not clear but they biologically have no clear axis.  Ikeitans seem to follow gender identity even less than utanguis do, as is adult ikeitans are the most aggressive about the antidozinism.  They also have the most rogue ikeitans (ikeitans that sympathize with the dozinist symbiosis).  

Elder- Elder Ikeitans are jaded by the constant endless skirmishes and "ritual wars" with the dozinists in the vast overlapping volumes that the leviathan societies twine themselves between.  They continue the conflict on the belief if they do not, the dozinist treachery will strike them once more.  They have the most ikeitan wars veterans and the most flexibility in allegiances- if the custodians returned they would be the first cease hostility with the dozinists temporarily.  If the composers interfered too much even, they have temporarily made matches in hell as at least the dozinists share in the myth.  The entropy worshipping composers are too nihilistic!

Ancient - Ancient Ikeitans were the first ikeitans born as ikeitans.  While some bioships were reformed to be Ikeitans, others were born as ikeitans.  They share a collective trauma in the exodus and tend to look more floral instead of the the more biometallic, sleek form of the gen-3 ikeitans.  Do not be mistaken.  They often have many layers of authoritization to utilize ancient technologies and sprawl tech, with ancient wisdom leveraged in the long term plans to overturn the Dozin worship and liberate those enslaved by Dozin.  They wage a slower long game and are most prone to having more openness to peace with the dozinists in the belief they can win through the superiority of their tech and civilizational feats without need to ever fire a single RKM.  The disputes among the Urzine are as expected, tense and a more belligerent position continues to take hold in practice due to the weakness being sensed by their Gestalt and [[Metasyndicate]] enemies.

Eternal - Ikeitans are biologically immortal and the eternal ikeitan is imagined as a crystallized being.  Pure ikeitan, enameled as a blade to piece Dozin itself.  Such eternals are few and mostly reclusive, being well alive before even when the term ikeitan was on record.  The earliest bioships that became ikeitans through modifications who were around from the time jiwar was full of huddled and afraid utanguis fleeing the failed utopia of the Prospectors nearly two millennia ago.
