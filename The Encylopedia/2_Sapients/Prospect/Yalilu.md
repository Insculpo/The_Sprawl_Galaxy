The Yalilu / Yaliluci / Yalilous (pronounce the J like a y)

The Jalilu are a species that is on average around 7' in height, with a tall stature bolstered by their curved oblong head.  Their overall stature having a relatively lean build, the design of their upper body being pigeon chested, however their protruding chest depending in the seasons may straighten out.

The jalilu's most distinctive biological trait is their seasonal adaptations that are affected by the temperature and humidity of an environment; a trait shared by many species of the world of Galiliois due to the radical changes in the temperature of their planet caused by their native binary star system having both a red dwarf and and a G-type star that their planet orbits the M-class of.

The Jalilu species is a species of bipeds 7' tall and having a build that ranges between think and lanky to thick and bulky depending on the temperature.  The jalilu's skin changes color depending on the temperature on the body and changes color based on emotion on the head.  The Jalilu also will molt their skin for the summer and get blubber-like fat in the winter.

The m-class star has 3 Jovian worlds, one of which having the home world of Galilous.

Three of the seasons winter sun is dominant in the sky, three of the seasons it is the summer sun that is dominant.

**History**

The Yalilu are one of the few humanoids out there, a rather soggy one at that with a flat, salamander-like head adorned in a tentacle beard regardless of gender.  Their legs who had an iron age civilization dominating their world when discovered by the [[Ikeitans]].  The Yalilu are one of the two main species the Ikeitans have adopted as both clients and crew, which the Yalilu eagerly did as the Yalilu civilization that dominated the world (The Ecumenical Yalilu) did so with a fleet of ships that humans would compare to the dragon boats Koreans sailed with.  The Yalilu’s relationship with the Ikeitians is viewed as father and son instead of as mortal & god; for the Ecumenical Yalilu believed in a god of the sea as the Omni-lord of the cosmos.  

They assumed the Ikeitians to be one of god’s creatures of the cosmic realm.  The Yalilu’s belief in any god however would go poorly for them when the Ikeitians found out.  

The Ecumene rebelled against the order in its arrogance at these creatures and were horribly slaughtered.  The Yalilu were forced by the Ikeitians to dismantle all their temples to the one-and-only and those who refused were systemically wiped out while those who renounced their god were integrated to the Ikeitan fold.  The power of the Urzine Ikeitians, now in the open led to the submission of the world which traditionally had been so cowed by the Ecumene’s monopoly of the sea as rebellious provinces shifted to the Ikeitans in hopes of a better future which they partially got.  Still they have overlords, but at least they can travel the stars as long as they listen to the wisdom to the new overlords.  

Nowadays, centuries after the conquest the Yalilu are part of the Ikeitians like cells in a body.  They go wherever Ikeitians go and repurpose themselves as whatever the Ikeitians see fit.  The Yalilu have since spread to other factions, but remain mostly a Ikeitan client and often are seen together.  The Yalilu often do not really accept their condition as a thrall sapient and have internalized their condition to degrees too hard to really penetrate.  Call a loyalist enslaved, they respond they have currency.  Point out the bulk is worthless outside Ikeitan controlled systems and they deflect once more.  Non-loyalist Yalilu meanwhile, continue to operate in secret and in spaces of ambiguity in ever more esoteric ways to evade the gaze of the Dream Agents and other such monitoring entities.
