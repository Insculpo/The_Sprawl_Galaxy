First off, their home world is called [[Liduzum]][1] and it orbits a brown dwarf pretty close.  So close there's IR radiation problems, but the magnetic field handles the worst of it.  They are sulfuric acid dwellers as the vulcanism on their world from the tidal forces meant you get that mega yellowstone kind of realm in places.  A lot of purple flora despite the closeness of the planet to the brown dwarf.  The ecology of Liduzum isn't well realized beyond the yellow-purple coloration of life on the world from the kind of world it is.  The Whandi individually aren't big, but the world is not at the same gravity of earth and there is a surprising amount of oxygen thanks to the photolysis of SO2 into O2 and S2[2].  So the world is pretty flammable.  Thankfully the whandi have resilience to acid and fire, which is good for them as their world is full of those two substances.  The world isn't a venusian hellscape due to the local biosphere containing the greenhouse effect and a T1-class brown dwarf is not nearly as energetic as the sun is so the geological cycles also help in keeping temperatures regulated.   

  

Liduzum has constantly changing sky colors and crystal filled realms of Liduzum.  The psychedelic realm is full of scuttling organisms, whose gliding and long limbed shapes/forms come from the local fauna being evolved directly from the flora.  The core aspect of the ecology is in effect, one built around branching organisms that create web-like superstructures across large parts of the world.  These broken branch organisms can than merge to other organisms of similar enough genetics to create offspring. 

  

The Whandl are among the scuttling types, a socialized species that due to the messiness of the ecology created an environment which favored intelligence.

**Whandl Biology and Sociology**
  
Now onto what Whandl are in their pathos.  Since what is sapience without pathology? 

The Whandl socially are in a distinctive space, as they do like to group up but have shockingly humanoid (given how alien they are physiologically from humans) social structures in dominance hierarchy and a degree of individualism.  Despite this, their means of reproduction leads them to behavioral patterns that can be alienating to humans regardless.  For one, the Whandi reproduce through severed limbs.  Male whandi severs a limb.  Which one no doesn't, being severed in of itself makes it produce gametes.  Female Whandl fertilizes the severed limb and that severed limb becomes what amounts to an egg purse.  Pretty gross to a human, but think how gross humans would seem in their reproduction to any species that lays eggs.   

Still, that creates different dynamics.  Male Whandl have a limit on how much they reproduce, which is 4 times (each severed limb can incubate multiple baby Whandl, however).  Sounds limiting but recall, Whandi are a social species.  A fully severed male Whandi is usually cared for by their children and mates except in the most heartless of Whandi societies as the severed whandi only severed their limbs, not their brain and so elder severed Whandi acted as guides in the depths of Liduzum.  Fast forwarding to when the Whandl were given regenerative biotech by the Utanguis, the male Whandi in modern civilization always has more limbs to sever from themselves.  Some even give themselves more limbs, to sever them.  Limb severence as a punishment also takes on different meaning, as it means that male Whandl gets one less batch of offspring per punitive severance. 

Female Whandl meanwhile keep their limbs, but in a peculiar phenomena will sometimes sever their own limbs.  The Whandl fixation on limb severance has no gender boundary and female Whandl have proven very observant of severance events, often encouraging prospective mates to sever limbs for them. More assertive female Whandl may sever a male Whandi's limb themselves.  The Whandl however, have more to their kind than that. 

Their social structures were built around batch-raised kin groups who at the mouse size of a hatchling Whandl needed to cooperate well if they are to survive to adulthood.  As they all knew and cooperated from birth, they can be very interconnected batches with Whandl who were the lone born of a batch often struggling to deal with other Whandi.  However being lone born has its benefits, such as more direct care from elder Whandi and in how they often are more independent.  Such dynamic is not rare, indeed the batches of a Whandl born of the same set of limbs or the same mother depending on the culture in particular often are raised in larger filial groups that from there will also be part of the larger association that the elder Whandl manage, with severed ones and such acting as a council and special class of wise minds.  Female whandi often make up the defensive forces of the association as they are less likely to get severed.  However they take orders from severed male Whandi as the severed in pre-contact history were regarded as the smart ones.  In part because they lacked limbs, but still had eyes and mind so they often specialized to reading and speaking more.[3] 

The Whandl organize into another kind of organization that loosely work as cooperatives, as all the Whandl own part of the cooperative-type organization.  They often stratified with scale, especially the mining cooperatives on Liduzum that despite being called mining cooperatives operated more akin to house builders as the mining is to make underground living space.  Harvesting and Extracting cooperatives also existed with a similar mindset.  Within all this, more criminal elements exist in the form of smuggler and gang batches that scurry about the vulcan areas few Whandl thread.  This is all before contact, where it is clear while the Whandl didn't get to space faring capacity they did manage a complex web work of societal organizations and metallurgical capacity (even if they prefer using brittle, sharp tools for engraving, severing and mining deposits). 

*Whandl emotional states*

Disjointed Bliss  
Disjointed Bliss is a result of the a sense of “disjointedness” which for the Whandl is a bliss-like feeling  

Stagnant Content  
A kind of stale, complacent feeling that is loosely understood as boredom if there was no actual boredom.  The Whandl don't appear to have boredom, instead they have a concept of “stagnant content” where they mostly just are existing as they are without really being bored, just in a stagnant state state of ‘content’ until something perks their interest

Acidic Suspicion  
When something bothers them, it increases their acidity to a degree as the suspicion has them sweating acidic fluids.  That sweat is signaling they do not like what they’re hearing and are suspicious of you.  

Limb Feel  
Or “feeling limby”, which is when a Whandl’s limbs get more erratic as a result of excitement, stimuli and something that has perturbed them be it something you said or just some other thing on their mind.  

Helpful Vindication  
Whandl can often feel vindicated when they’re being helpful, the vindication coming from it being clear their help is needed and so they take a kind of end to their own sense of denial in the act.


**Geomantic belief systems and uplifting to the Vusidian Dominion**

At the time of contact, it is very likely the Whandl were effectively a near-industrial civilization when the Vusidian Dominion found their kind and made them part of the greatest Dozinist hierarchy.  The local Whandi notions and beliefs were deeply inundated around a mix of beliefs, such as the belief in breatherism which is basically the notion the world was formed from the breath of volcanos.  In a way it was them stating a truth more than a solid religion, however much the beliefs in breatherism made colonies around volcanoes more common than they reasonably should have been.  The Whandl breatherists noticed how they had more yields in the branching flora in those regions and so the high risk, high reward life of the breatherist.  There also of course were the obligatory severing cults.  The scale of the universe was a subject of speculation, but the Whandi glass making tech was limited.  They used to think the brown dwarf the center of creation, that it wasn't even a small dim object at all.  To them, Lidus (what they called the brown dwarf) was the central body and the other worlds their astronomers noticed, parts of Lidus to which Liduzum was the mouthpiece.  So to the Whandl, they were and are the voice of Lidus.  They speak for Lidus from Liduzum. 

So there was not much to the Whandl that the idea of some greater symbiotic cosmic order held, but the Vusidian Dominion had spaceships and the Whandl did not so some of the larger cooperatives saw the truth of their situation and converted to [[Dozinism]], indeed some even sought to run up the hierarchy instead of risk the death of Liduzum to the vast leviathan civilization they now find at their small, dim system in the cosmic void.  Other Whandl proved more belligerent, especially the breatherist groups who only loosely played to get tech from the interloping invaders.  A guerrilla division was setup by the breatherists, but they stayed their fire as they knew they would be crushed at the horrific tech the Vusidians welded.  The heavily modified abominations that prowled about with the massive overlords who landed on their world.  The basic ability any space faring civ has to strike from the sky especially disturbed them.  So playing along was the best route to most Whandl who accepted the client status and would be rewarded for their 'loyalty' by the Vusidians in due time with augments that enabled the capability to regenerate limbs.  Which led to an uptick in loyalists in the short term, but the Whandl proved a prominent force in the Dominion regardless.  
  
Indeed, to the point the Whandl would become one of the major species of [[Prospect Space]] as the Whandl integration as an event happened in the year 1120 AD, it is the year 2800 AD.  There is in the present no Vusidian Dominion, and even in the times of the Dominion the vast growth of Whandl populations and ability to colonize sulfuric worlds, develop advanced geoengineering tech, plasma weaponry and the Vulcan-class heat management systems that are used even by humans.  The Whandi integrated themselves with multiple factions within the Dominion and eventually managed to make a faction of their own- as the wise severed ones sought to do at the right time and place.  The instability of the dominion with the pilot's revolt gave them the inwards path they needed to break into more space industries and develop advanced biotech for sulfuric life they would also give to the [[Vopson]] who they had a tedious affinity with.  The Vopson saw the Whandi as lesser, the Whandi resented how much prestige the Vopson had.  Regardless more cross-communication between Vopson and Whandi occurred to the point one found Whandl in Vopson swarms and Vopson in Whandi organizations, including rogue organizations where the proclivities of the Vopson weren't seen as a downside.  They rarely did understand each other but still found the Vopson had their uses.  The Whandi raid groups were particularly bad with the downfall of the Dominion. 

Despite the sordid reputation and stereotyping to being a raider species, they are individuals.  They aren’t a swarm mind like the Vopson, they are as a result found all over the place in a wide range of activities/roles including as station helpers, mercs, shock troops, mining managers and traders. In modern prospect space, the Whandi are a commonplace species that take some pride in being one of the species to keep their homeworld of Liduzum intact in spite of the custodian's wrath.  However intact a cosmopolitan ecumenopolis built around geoengineering, kinetic power and a cosmopolitan meshwork full of bioengineered life can be.



  

  

[1](a world larger than Mars but smaller than Venus, 0.7Gs and yes this is large enough to have a magnetic field, Ganymede has one and it is a lot smaller!)  

  

[2] Sulfur Dioxide is a pretty horrible substance... if you're a human.  Sulfur Dioxide can be an abiotic oxygen source, not to the extent having plants producing it does but it is a silver lining for a biosphere that uses oxygen on a world where vulcanism is common.
