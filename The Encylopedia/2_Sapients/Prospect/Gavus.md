### Gavus

2018:

Gavus is a being who dwells on an ice giant, a massive one whose clouded thoughts get in the way of everything else in its total insularity and stormy manipulation a of its world and biosphere, mainly in the name of propagating itself wherever possible by ensuring the wind flux on its world keeps its form in existence- it is a layered cellular form and so it needs to keep order wherever possible.  It is not too privy to outsiders and is able to cause all matter of chaos in the name of keeping stability in the flows, which keep its forms alive.  The flows it is the self-proclaimed master of and the self-proclaimed engineer of.  It engineered the wind systems of a whole planet in the name of enriching itself and giving the gas giant a incredibly anomalous, highly regimental cloudscape.  

------------------------
2021:

Gavus as a force is a primordial jovian mind built as a product of complex interconnections between the ecology and cloud systems which have hit an intricate interplay between each other.  It was these flows which led to the emergence of the being known as Gavus, a super intelligence that centralizes and manages these systems as it experiments with everything it can.  It realizes it is alone in the depths of a far greater creation but for the longest time had to make do with an increasingly elaborate mesh work of cellularized, modularized and directed set of gel-like organisms that compose its vast essence that has directed and fluxed the convection currents of itself to a complex array of sub-societies and beings all part of Gavus in their own way.  \

Such activities created an anomalous cloud scape where one sees industrialized patterns of flow that are very distinguished from your usual cloud systems.  It had actively moved for contact, making beacons of itself to attract whatever may be out there uncertain if it had basically committed the cosmic equivalent of inviting a dangerous apex predator or not.  Gavus therefore spent the time building up, knowing that its isolation led to it making a horrible, horrible mistake.  For eventually such beings did come for Gavus.  First in the form of unremarkable [[Vopson]] looters who got ripped to shreds by all the manipulated cloud systems Gavus was able to leverage.

Luckily for Gavus, members of the Cosmic Cloud learned of Gavus and its plight.  So they sent their own envoys who as [[Sarkic]] managed to find some means of communicating to Gavus.  Something the Vopson in the area just couldn't and something other factions have yet to truly do outside the gatekeeping the Cosmic Cloud began to have on Gavus.  The Cosmic Cloud's locals were infatuated with Gavus, more cultists obsessed with Gavus began to fester about the sector doing whatever inane stuff Gavus wanted.  For Gavus saw in these void beings a way to extend itself far beyond its singular ball of gas and instead to the greater universe.  However such ambitions had the problem that two more factions with their own agendas for Gavus also showed up. 


In the Gavus ecology, there can be found:

-"Critters", who are simply recyclers for Gavus that collect whatever detritus there is and feed themselves back into the greater Gavus ecology.
-"Stabbers", who are large gel membraned creatures that often have been used to deal with anomalous growths within itself or with outside intrusions.  Such stabbers have been augmented heavily to allow for shocking maneuvers not naturally possible for such organisms
-"Cyclones", vast storm systems that are consciously made to clean up, fix and otherwise diffuse parts of its operations.  They also are manifested against hostile forces.  For Gavus as it stands now didn't start as one Gavus and the constant 'growth' threat as a cancer on itself persists.
-"Crystal Storms", crystal storms are storms that emit ball lightning and are a mobile harm field that deals additional EMP damage.
-"Rainbows", these glittery anomalous cloud forms are much more aggressive vortices that act almost like eyes for Gavus, they are the quickest means to get a message from Gavus by waiting around/evading their chaotic spews to get messages.  They are also dangerous enemies due to being ticking time bombs of various reactive and combustible substances kept in a metastable state.  They deal Gamma damage.
-"Floaters", megafaunal entities that often exist with jet streams leading between them that are the main way you initiate conversations with Gavus.
-"Gloppers", large organisms that slowly move around that spread antibodies when nothing else purges a threat.

Traits:
