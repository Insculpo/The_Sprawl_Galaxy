## Overview  
  
The Utanguis are three separate species combined into a single sapient being. If these species were separated they would never have made a massive interstellar civilization. The heads are the Cyrs, the bodies are the Awa and the limbs are the Loka. Multiple combinations of head and limb exist, but universally a Utanguis will have only a single body to separate itself from another ‘individual’.  The Utanguis are individualistic minded, but not in the same way as us. All the three species part of a Utanguis are viewed as the same individual and aggressively so; denying that they are the same is viewed as an insult. The Utanguis identify shifts as parts of itself are born and die, attaching and detaching.  
  
The death of the Awa (body), the least sapient part of a Utanguis, ironically is usually viewed as the “death” of an individual.  This is even if the head and limbs survive as the body usually lives longer than the head or limbs. A Utanguis can have a single limb, five limbs, two heads and so forth. The limit is usually two heads and five limbs, anymore and “mental disorders” happen like insanity, plain and simple insanity. Not to mention it risks encumbering the Awa.  Mind the most common formation is two arms and one head, but three or single armed Utanguis are hardly rare.  
  
## Biology  
  
 The Cyrs are symbionts who direct and control the Awas to better pastures in nature.  As they developed, their sapience in response to integrating the Loka into their survival strategy alead to more complexity of behavior.  Including the tool manipulation of the Loka than the creation of shelters, fire and new ways to defend the Awas from would be predators.  The intelligence of the Cyrus and dexterity of the Loka also lead to an increase food yields for the Awas through the artificial creation of grazing land.  

The Cyrs is smart, often directing the other two species and putting much of its thought process to more systemic planning and partial communication- however the more sociable Loka tend to like talking more.  The Cyrs communicate in a series of weird, jittery hums while the Loka communicate in a more guttural fashion.  The Cyrs is quite big as far as parasites go, relying on a younger, more larval form to latch onto their host before becoming part of the Awas itself.  The Cyrs can adapt this system to machinery as well, for this reason alone neural robotic technologies are very frequently used by the Utanguis.  The Cyrs are loosely associated beings usually.  They're not as social as humans are.  However, they do have mating selection systems comparable to birds.  For that reason the males tend to have more elaborate chilla and vibrant coloration.  The Cyrs are intelligent and sociable despite this, but only started forming large social groups after a million years of post-convergence evolution.  
  
The Awas is a large, tetrapodal herbivore which exist in a phyla separate from the Cyrs or Loka, but benefit from their parasitic overlords greatly.  Awas are more or less herd animals, with a collective mode of social organization.  The Awas live long and have a reputation for storing things.  Be it information, physical cargo or nutrition in their large humps.  The Awas can handle a several hundred kilograms of weight before being too encumbered.  The Awas basically are a pack animal who gained a state of semi-sapience from their symbiotic relationship with the Cyrs and don’t seem bothered by this relationship even in modern times.  After all, the Cyrs and Loka "pay their rent" in a figurative sense.  
  
The Loka are the limbs and hands of the Utanguis and are of an intelligence between the Awas and Cyrs, but their ingenuity and dexterity (for their whole lifestyle is based around their handibles).  They are feisty, opportunistic beings who in nature were stalkers and ambushers.  They make use of their mandible in an extremely diverse set of ways, from digging traps to making tools and ambush snatching food to eat.  They're social creatures and can generate large numbers, with whole regions simply infested in Loka.  However, the lack of long-term mobility meant that the Loka in earlier history would be outcompeted by the gestalt forms of the Utanguis.  Non-combined Loka simply lack the platform the Awas give.  At some point nearly a million years ago there was Loka who found the Awas as a useful way to get around and the Cyrs were tolerated since the Loka liked wrapping around the hump while the Cyrs just stood there on top.  The Cyrs also is just too big.  Usually Two Loka co-habit an Awas any combination of gender.  The Loka have language as well.  The Loka languages complicate the Utanguis writing system so much than a mutual script is what would become dominate in the Epoch of Unifiers.  The Loka have developed a much more intense relationship with the Cyrs, as the Cyrs and Loka need each other to make fire, tools and eventually more sophisticated technologies/architecture.  The Loka are segmented and can stiffen/loosen their many joints as needed.  The Loka can exist independently, but without the mobility of the Awas the networks of communication that led to increasingly more complex inventions, tools and ideas would likely not have come to being.  
  
The Utanguis are a very freakish anomaly in the existence of life, to say the least.  The Utanguis view this ‘anomaly’ as proof of some greater cause of their existence, but what this cause is has never really been divined beyond a sense of exceptionalism the Utanguis have had only reinforced in their dominance of our part of the galaxy (so is it really our part of the galaxy?)  
  
The Utanguis are a dominant and commonly seen sapient in [[Prospect Space]].  
  
A couple “special” variants of Utanguis formation also exist.

  
## Trauma Bonds

A trauma bond Uranguis is an utanguis who was born from surviving a massacre on the battlefield. They are a figure of fascination in multiple utanguis societies to this day, as they are the surviving arms and body left over from so much severance and death coming together to form a new Utanguis so as to be "complete" again and so able to cope with the reality of their situation.

## Recombinants

Recombinant Utanguis basically take arms and heads from each other and recombine to create novel selves. It is generally regarded as a mutual assisted suicide, killing one's self and another self to make 2 new selves;  It is a rare practice, but not unheard of.  It is most common in Biomorphic sectors of activity.

### The Cyrloka  
  
The Cyrloka are trans-Utanguis entities that are only possible with a machine/synth replacement of the Awas. They’re a Very diverse class of Utanguis that act much like cyborgs and are quite horrifying due to being so "unnatural" to the Majority in Dozinist Utanguis societies (but in various other societies they are increasingly embraced and even a sizable portion of the populace).  
  
#### The divided  
  
Cyrs and Loka that have decided to go against millennia of history believing the whole composite thing to be obsolete and pointless weight. However, they also ended up severing the intimate relations they once had to each other, causing serious tensions in regards to how a independent Cyrs species or a independent Loka species will cooperate or if they will cooperate instead of creating more divides in a already culturally and linguistically divided mess that is the modern Utanguis. There is so many philosophical wars fought over this one issue it is insane simply due to the implications- how can the Utanguis bring harmony to hundreds of species if harmony can't be achieved with the mere three the Utanguis composes itself as?

The Utanguis proved to have the following feelings:

-clumpy

-relaxed

-burning

-livid

-solid

-fluid

-lopped

-jittering

-heat burdened

-light

-heavy
