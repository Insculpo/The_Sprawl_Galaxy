### Overview

The Ivoltic are a collective biosphere built through a communal relationship between millions of species cooperating to the fugue of existence.

The Ivoltic started off as cultivated by the Violet, a mega organism whose pheromone network allowed for a slow thinking, global brain in a stable enough environment.

### Biology

This body has in its base a storage of decomposers and memories which over time it has used to make much more elaborate pheromone can mixtures from the corpses of dead animals.  The red stuff is its gamete spreading mechanism.
The Ivoltic festered about a world which was a festering corpse, existing and coming to play after a mass extinction killed off 70% of all life on the origin world of the Violet.  The Violet is a low gravity world, so a lot of architecture impossible on our world was very possible here, such as sky networks of pheromones transported by super highways of large flying creatures known as the Gilded Winged.

They share the world with those driller critters from your nature brain storm.  As they come from the same kingdom.  The violet/yellow scheme of the kingdom the towers are made from hold a strong relationship anyways.  The yellow coloration of much the life on this world is a product of a fluke, mainly it worked earlier on and so yellow/brown variations stuck due to the sandy Savannas and rocky environments which the sparse woods exist in.  They are on a somewhat Xeric, but forested world laden in shrublands and firestorm riddled forests.  It is dry, badlands environment in many parts of the world which can shift towards forested regions at the caps where you come across violet trees on this temperate EarthLike world still recovering from a mass exon goon that occurred just a few million years earlier.

### Psychology

For in the destruction came to form the Ivoltic, who accelerated the rebirth of the biosphere far faster that it naturally should have happened.  The Ivoltic over time surged its presence in making a biosphere of diligent working fauna that did its bidding in exchange for intelligence, basically uplifting hundreds of species and doing so in a deeply inter-pendant fashion.  

This is what became the Ivoltic, a gaian ecosystem forged through artificial selection by plants seeking their own survival and becoming intelligent in the process, with a global network they used to rapidly mold one phyla of animal life on their world into their workforce.  Eventually they figured themselves into a series of technological leaps, warfare being a internal matter usually over the host of troubles which come with conformity in thought.  These thought wars often left their workers autonomous, and this enhanced autonomy led to rebellions and conflicts which went on for millennia in the "wild" period where many species of animals made their own cultural norms and ways of life while also murdering each other.  Eventually came a new harmony between all life, from the very makers of their kind.  Ever since they have become a deeply collectivized, mutualism oriented species who have deep disdain for those not of the Ivoltic.  They are in constant dread of the non-Ivoltic as they wont work in their system.

The Ivoltic path of development made space travel hard, however they eventually they did it due to their world being small and dying.  The Ivoltic however became much more diversified and abstracted from all matter of developments in integration.  The Ivoltic however kept their cooperative culture amazingly persistently, across many worlds and many environments even as the Clades deviated.  The Ivoltic advanced in many, many unpredictable ways as their communitarian ecology sought to bring their ways to the more savage ecologies which permeate the universe- to bring true life to the stars.
