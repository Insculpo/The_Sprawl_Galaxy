### Overview

Pasis are organosilicate sapients who function in thought clouds and are almost like living robots The Pasis rely on ammonia as a solvent and are quite alien as a result not even eating food.  The Pasis lived on a high gravity, frigid world that the Utanguis came across primarily by accident and managed to conquer the Pasis for their own ends as they have multiple other species.  The Pasis have proven to be of great use in civilization, as they are persistent beings who can withstand almost any environmental condition (if they have ammonia to juice them up) due to not needing to breath air; their only application of breathing is as communication.  Their metabolism is weak, but not much weaker than us as they are extremely efficient at energy use and can directly metabolize energy from heat and lightning.  The Pasis are large beings whose high gravity origins are obvious, their stumpy and spread out body plan is indicative of the punishing gravity that shaped them.  The Pasis are a common sight in Utanguis controlled sectors, used frequently as work mules on cold worlds and are very easy to manipulate.  The Pasis do think and can adapt well, it’s just that they have no real care if they are oppressed or not; only if they are being killed which they aren’t.  The Pasis lack any faction of their own, instead being clients of multiple societies.
