### Overview

The Zakkai are aliens who breath sulfur instead of oxygen and prefer much more acidic environments than we do.  The Zakkai were planet bound aliens until the [[Fosskemian]] happened upon them, causing all matter of intended chaos and are perhaps the posterchild for victims of the [[Metasyndicate]]’s thinking for they are a species that are built order, family and ritual.  The Metasyndicate ‘liberated’ them from that, causing crushing agony for their species from forced assimilation without any amends whatsoever; they were pretty much forced to accept a modern system of thought and could do little about it.  The Zakkai are very alien in appearance and are huge compared to us.  The Zakkai work in small groups and for all their intellect never advanced beyond stone age technology, until the Fosskemian came.
