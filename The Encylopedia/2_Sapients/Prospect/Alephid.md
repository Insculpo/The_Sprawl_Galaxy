### Overview

Alephids are tentacle filled shelled sapients with two layers of tentacles, the outer layer being a webbed system to help sort and feel the vibrations around them while the inner layer consists of more prehensile tentacles they used to make and manipulate tools in their environment.  Alephids are critters in a black shell who collect tons of glowing moss for mating attraction primarily, as well as a means of attracting feeder creatures to deal with parasites outside the mold.  Their kind has a huge range of high altitude cultures living within the oceanic mountain ranges they view as safe- being utterly terrified of the Samala in the great expanses.  Indeed, traversing the great expanse to colonize new underwater mountains is one of the more impressive aspects of their primitive, ocean limited civilization.  Their mythology is filled with numerous accounts of Samala, oceanic parasites granting magical powers and all matter of spearing tips.
