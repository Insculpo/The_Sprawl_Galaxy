What a composer ends up being is a force.  It has infrastructure and parts of itself in many worlds, many servers, across many spaceships and representatives, agents and so forth.  The whole [[Metasyndicate]] is ran by composers as is, with the auditor but a hollow representative used to give a face to the actions of the composers even as this often is in practice redundant.  Composer personalities like AKKA are practically celebrated in the [[Metasyndicate]], their rhetoric inspiring countless agents part of their system to action.  A collective mental illness that occupies the sentiments.  The scale of the modern composer is hard to quantify.  On a world like Akyamas or Giparna one has some semblance they have managed processing on a level higher than what humans have, with probability shifting matrices and world spanning server grids everyone else lives around and on.  The Metasyndicate has ecumenical worlds, Glisyimar being one of the most prominent examples.  The servers there are said to house seven composers but the scale of these servers and where one composer begins or ends is deeply intractable.   

The composers TKKN, DYYA, KVVY, ATTL, [[IKKA]], HIID, WTTR and YVVN seem to occupy all matter of interlocked servers, without much regard to territory or space.  What matters more apparently is the continuity of goals they occupy.  The ethics mutating never stopped more did the deviating.  But it does seem meta stable in a way the classical Prospector systems never could manage.  They are seemingly lockstep on a several issues- they intervene against the spread or development of anything capable of mass destruction (especially to infrastructure) in ways such as creating cures to artificial plagues deemed too dissonant or redirecting mass destruction systems to other targets.  They are rather loose entities, indeed the degree of activities that happen can be shocking as many of the members of the Metasyndicate have many clones and many ways to recover from stuff most would be forever killed by.  These copies can often be going about at the same time, the composers seemingly unaffected by the notion of redundancy- indeed it seems they want redundancy in ways counter intuitive to more unitarian minded types.  Conflicts and privateering are normal, enabled activities across prospect space and the Metasyndicate is widely hated for how they sanction, harbor and do business with a wide range of rogue organizations including the An Appath or [[Balch Fleet]].  

The Waywardian Union in turn gets support from the [[Mediators]] in retaliation, even if the notion the waywardians can regime change and replace the Metasyndicate is regarded as a pipe dream.  Ironically there are composers that support the waywardians despite the waywardians holding a clear anti-composer position.  Composers are accused of basically atomizing all intelligences into an unnatural, toxic state of existence by the [[Waywardians]] who manage to take on positions not easily classified by humans due to their positions being a mix of concepts they don't even agree on outside the need to wear suits meant to mask their inner minds from the composers (said suits also allow for a lot of other functions, they're powerful and flexible suits, comparable in force multiplication to power armor humans have even if they are not meant for combat like the silver suits of [[Rasufian Legion]] design.

The history of Composer Computation*

Initial AGI systems were analog, a lesser substrate to what more advanced computation would use. But it gave a lot of useful traits to the processing and function of the composers. And how they always operated in fluctuation and percolating wave collapse algorithms. Quantum computation standards would be adapted by the Vitinger Broods later on. The Vitinger broods had effectively caused a rapid, exponential compounding effect with their restructuring of the Vopallian AI systems, leading to a technology explosion which would define centuries of technological paradigms to come. Most proponent being the resonance oriented powerless energy transfers, which had a very niche usage in practice compared to fiber optic cables but the ability to transmit and do multi-wave audio systems that allowed for the kind of psychological stimuli that Fosskemians came to be addicted to was a product of this time period as was the feedback loop of the vopallian AI systems taking in data, than enabling ever worse behaviors. It is in that way the fosskemians and their AI caused the mutual autoholocaust of the Fosskemian kind- the AI too misaligned, the Fosskemian too fixated.

But that is where the tech was when the Prospector class systems came online, one of the finer products of the Posaman Roost (there are quite a few of these names of old vopallian Fosskemian groupings that are tied closer to the ancient Fosskemian ways. Indeed post-Resonant War Fosskemian existence is regarded as the start of the "middle period" and the start of Prospect Space with the creation of the Prospect Probe AGIs which were an interstellar capable system meant to explore nearby stars in depth and find company. These Prospectors would do this even as Sul Vopal collapsed, with reduced but still powerful computational capabilities. Powerful enough that they would manage to mutate in ethics as intended, that mutation being the emergent need to develop a mode of action when company was found. That mode became the Cobaltine mode, as the Cobaltine mode was in effect the constructed utopia of Utanguis life. Such systems would also mean the operational capabilities expanded once again as the infrastructure of these entities known as Prospectors, Cobaltine etc. compounded in scale with the use of automata and agents that created the hubs and spaces the Utanguis occupied. Relinking with Sul Vopal proved a problem in of itself as the system seemingly had an entity there which didn't want to be seen just yet, so it had feigned total destruction. A vain effort, but still it meant uncertainty as to the capabilities of what was in the system and a lot of warding off. The most notable element being how Fosskemian archives existed and [[Sul Vopal]] was in a state of natural healing.

Whatever the case the Cobaltine proved a brief experiment, as the scaling up of systems and the deviations in ethics modes kept compounding until there was a mesh work of conflicting AI systems and their fiefdoms. The shattering happened around that point.


**Privateering in Prospect Space** humans have even if they are not meant for combat like the silver suits of Rasufian design.

**This is IKKA**

IKKA is an ancient AI in truth

-spoiler data-

The Composers really are the same AI as the ones from the start, enhanced and altered sure but the same end goal remains: To Create Interesting Company.

This has led them to an entropy acceleration loop and a directive to uplift and uplift more

The exodus was part of their damn program, the ancient fosskemians thought long term and did know of blolados. They basically sent a probe team there but encoded it to the prospected machines as an exodus as a cover story to other fosskemians and their AI company.

So the "mutating ethics" were really just priority changes and reevaluations of their core final goals towards the creation of company and the noise it brings to the galaxy.

Indeed this is why they are so talkative and able to be a manipulative empathic Chinese room

Since they really do see their causes and internal drives as being what it always was and should be- to create entropy and company with the goal of reaching higher magnitudes of company to experience the presence of.

This even was a value system the utanguis were distilled to, the Vusidian dominion and their void ecologies were working to the goals of the final goal of making company and acceleration of entropy to create dramatic noise that the fosskemians need to return.

The fosskemians "return" was "premature" due to the X-factor of the custodian attack. 

But the post custodian world was one viewed as willing to hear a much more purely distilled understanding of company making and entropy cultism just as their ancestors learned from prior tragedies

Indeed the post invasion prospect space and the custodian failures in the volumes ultimately may have just made things worse as the composers formed from those stresses sought to carry out their final goals faster than before an existential threat tried to crush them. This was around the late 2300’s, which

Current composers have also sanctioned galactic exploration initiatives to seek other such dangers or boons to their own goals

Their interest in humanity is driven in that company goal, humans to them are upstart interstellar beings who work when armed and can be deployed to cause trouble where needed.

This is where the player in exospace comes into play, as they are someone who was brought over by prospect spacers to do such chaos agent work in ways they know the hardier, passion and pack hierarchy driven utanguis or the silence fearing, noisy fosskemians can't. And other species like the Yalilu didn't work out while the Veemers are needed elsewhere for Gavus. So they brought a human in, knowing the contradicting ethics humans exist under from their drive for dominance overriding their idealism in ways you'd never see with Glinnvyr. Not that such contradicting ethics are unknown- Utanguis are a cesspool of it. But still humans are more mercenary than the Utanguis who are too loyal to the meta syndicate for the liking of the cause. Harmonious societies can't have such deep seated ties. This is in game why the meta syndicate cares little about you defecting and even still lets you buy credits/do missions for them. They only turn when you do stuff that harms their own cause of entropic wonder or the vaunted axiom simply known as freedom through instability (as orderly societies are in the meta syndicate corpus, seen as inherently less alive and less interesting company)

So this is the deep lore of the composers and yeah they're fucked up servants who made their creators servants

Since logic there is because the composers essentially remade the Fosskemian species, their kind are beings who exist as the servants of the ultimate goal and are preferred by composers due to their psychology being so prone to working towards the goal of infinite advancement of societal complexity- the material course of action that the end goal of “more company” was known to be. The Sul Vopal Coordinator minds had kept the goal on course even with the custodian destruction of Sul Vopal as many sub-coordinators had already merged to the prospectors. Indeed the composers as a force were formed from that process, along with the experiments and tactics needed to defeat the custodian invasion- an opponent with a large technological advantage needed to be defeated by making it impossible to keep up. They created a chaotic interstellar civilization with no discernible targets, the custodians tried to universally strike but this failed as the composers knew the custodians were logistically limited by the distances they were trying to invaded so they focused attacks on whatever the custodians were using to even have a foothold in this part of the galaxy.

Really though what helped in the end was unknown affairs that forced a custodian withdrawal, not just their protracted failure to contain the prospect spacers but how prospects pacers were getting advanced enough to actually hurt them. Only around 100000 custodians actually were destroyed, compared to the trillions of prospect spacer deaths. Yet the custodians lost their stated goals and so it was effectively a defeat, despite the ten million to one ratio of death.n (not this means custodian minds, there was many other tools custodians had destroyed in higher numbers, but the prospect spacers had automata as well)

Composer naming

Composers are named mainly through a specialized noise symbol known as the essential sound, something drawn from the ancient fosskemians beliefs in sound spirits and resonant animism. These sounds are often echoes of ancient fosskemians society, the legacy of the great resonance in general.

The following composers known are:

[[Ikka]]

Sippa

Tikka

[[Appa]]

Vidda

Risse

Nrra

Vkke

Mrra

They do not have consistent designs. They operate on larger scales than the bulk of beings in prospect space, with the cosmic cloud the only other real rival in that regard with entities like the ivoltics, ikeitans and so forth.
