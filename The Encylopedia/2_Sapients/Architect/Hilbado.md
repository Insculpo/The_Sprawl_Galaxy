The Hilbado are inhabitants of [[Alkud]]

 and are notable for having only their creative use of their biology to make “civilization”.  They are, like many Alkudian life forms lithotrophs (mineral eaters).  The hilbado are highly magnetic naturally occurring entities from a world where self-modifying DNA is the norm, that is a world where reproduction is carried out in such a way that bio modifications faster than what usually occur happen out of the mother thinking modifications into their children.  The Hilbado are the tantamount form of such a biochemistry, having achieved a state of effective technology without ever inventing fire by manipulating magnetic currents with their own bodies to create force fields, energy weapons, telecommunications and a system of management/organization all without agriculture or an industrial complex to speak of- they just don't harvest materials because the only resources of value to them are their children. 
 
  They don't even seem to have much in the way of cultural norms, being a patchwork of connective tribes whose who collective outlook is based around a dualism between the world they can make and the world they can only consume.  Their forms, while diverse remain the same species for the most part due to reproduction being through males who inject their speed through the blood stream, with such extreme dimorphism usually betraying the seemingly non-gender oriented outlook they have simply because they don't see their males as even living things and they don't really act like such.
