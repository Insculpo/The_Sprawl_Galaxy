**The Harlapa ploy**

The harlapa are a strange, enigmatic force in the galaxy. Far from human contact, they aren't even something humans know outside what other societies have said of them. But their role in the ecumenical and potentially the reason why the galaxy is so flooded in intelligence is tied to them. This hasn't made them the most advanced civilization however- they are scattered. But they play very long games. The whole existence of the architects is because of them. The harlapans are the architects of a civilization that freed itself from the old cosmic order. Their wave was heard as a beacon to light forth civilizations. Their leveraging of their own matter has been how they persisted, the operant end goal of harlapan super intelligence is tied to ancient conspiracies embedded to existence itself. The tarpoids. The harlapa were their cancer. The byproduct of the first ones we call laniakeans.

In effect, two forces existed. They are enigmas. Too far advanced to really be defined by our pathetic, myopic terminology. Beyond advanced. It is just known they are there. We don't know much at all of them, beyond their occupancy of existence in a dreamlike way. The panpsychists were right. The intuition dismissed by materialists as illusion- faulty.

The implications of this reality is what Dozinists had uncovered long ago. The schisms of [[Dozinism]] came as the sprawl intruded on the earlier understanding of existence, where [[Dozin]] was more myopic in comprehension. But the explorers of Karbana [[Kinnis]] would uncover the sprawl's records and an ontological revolution broke out as new truths spread like a pandemic across the broken societies of the post-Vusidian period of violence. Schisms were but another layer. Indeed the revelations of the sprawl from Karbana unsettled countless minds in the disillusionment of a reality that took over existence.

The sprawl understanding of existence has no beginning or end. A civilization of infinities. They figured out how to make energy into mass. Make pocket universes. Be able to rewrite their own existence... the last one was their downfall. The solipsism of a galactic civilization distilled in a simplified form.

We can't say the nature of them.

We just don't know.

The meaning of existence may be known by them.

We never would grasp it.

**Harlapan Existence**

They are weird, very weird entities even by the standards set by the rest of the galaxy. Absurdly hard to destroy, yet use weak technology like gyrojets and stuff that is horribly out of date- compensating solely with being living programmable matter entities with their thralls. Their societal values are very much a pathological desire to return to the core, subsumed by it. The core drives them out, to find more of their remains, to than return back to the core. The harlapan factions are weird in that their purpose is extremely unified- all seek to bring and add to the core, which is seen as a form of higher enlightenment in the belief the critical mass of computronium will liberate them to the highest order of existence. They don’t like death unless it is death by subsumption. The coral machines never have any end to this, agency of limited value, with indoctrination being total.

They do have individual thoughts and beliefs, but their minds at the end of the day just care to find more of the harlapan matter and return it to the core. You can see this as dogmatic, but they would see you trying to break them from this directive as evil and degenerate. As if you are stripping them of what sense of purpose to existence they even have for cruel and arbitrary, if not outright sadistic reasons. They cannot be persuaded from working to the growth of the core, but they can be temporarily allied with either way, provided you understand this barrier to them and having a harlapan matter carrot to lead them around with.

The scion Harlapans are the most relatable ones to humans for the reasons above, other harlapan sub types are relatable to eusocial hive minds. Regardless, they do actually use thrilled species who are indoctrinated to believe in the all-importance of the core and how the core is their path to prosperity. The thralled planetbounders do not share the dogmatic drive for the cores, but see working for their masters as a means to living a better life and if they have to crush some other societies of alien origin to them, so be it. Harlapans will actively assault, raid and terrorize places in the name or the core as they try to find more of the harlapan matter. They see other civilizations as depriving them of the matter, of hiding it, of keeping them down. That their kind wasn’t even space faring until recently sounds peculiar but harlapan history is strange, they had been space faring twice before but were crushed by ancient societies and their pieces scattered. This is where the resentment and anger of their kind comes from, resentment over the progress forced away from them, of the hatred that spawned.

The wanderer Harlapans are very much nomads fronting as traders, that is until they can get a hit of harlapan matter and than they will trade anything for it. This makes them rather exploitable by upstart societies and the sprawl, who often game their trading to get back at their own rivals- not like the trader cares, as long as they get the program,able matter.

The questing Harlapans meanwhile, go out and use whatever they choose to get more harlapan matter. They are always seeking and willing to do missions for other societies if it means getting that harlapan matter so they may return to be one with the embrace and warmth of the core.

The vengeful Harlapans meanwhile are sent to wherever a harlapan was known to have been lost, so as to recover their fragments. Their cause of vengeance means that they come with the most thralls and automata to keep the possibility of losing their own matter to the enemy or void as low as possible.

**Harlapa Wave**

The sprawl collapse was one caused by its greater institutional consciousness and hyperspatial arrays falling apart, causing a cascading catastrophe that fragmented the storages into residual bits that modern societies know the sprawl as.

The sprawl did actually into it multiple upstart interstellar societies, of whom were assimilated into the lifestyle of shape shifting formals with the wisdom of the dioviermes to show the way.

Some dioviermes post sprawl collapse devolved their own kind further, seeking to just reset their kind out of sheer disgust for the abomination the sprawl had Been.
