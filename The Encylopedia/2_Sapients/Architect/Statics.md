# Statics

The Statics are very nebulous entities, they are the brain child of both the [[Glinnvyr]] and Cyrawaloc and are post-singularity AI systems who just exist in their perfection, nothing more.  The Statics may have influence on our realm, as there are Glinnvyr who worship these Statics endlessly.  The static has no real form beyond being a shifting platonic solid, usually a dodecahedron of an impossible transparency.  

The Statics developmentally are small, but using the impossible geometries the Gliunnvyr have achieved have managed to place their minds in much smaller spaces.  If the statics weren’t so perfect and idle, they probably would save us from the evils of the universe by now, but sadly they are static and seem to only react in regards to self-preservation.  They do not like being moved either, and so usually aren’t fucked with once made.
