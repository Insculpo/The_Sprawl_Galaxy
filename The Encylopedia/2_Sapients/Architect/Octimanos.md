### Overview

The Octimanos are the de-facto “best friend” of the [[Aveterriat]].  Some point in 1200 AD the world-state Barium Insight discovered them on a large desert planet in a neighboring star system.  The Barium Aveterriat effectively enslaved them for centuries, treating them pretty much as pets due to a sense of affection the Aveterriat found for these large sapients and their handiness.  The Octimanos are rocky creatures with silicone casings and have eight limbs that can be used as both arms and legs placed radially around their main body.  The Octimanos also have radially oriented eyes.  The Octimanos are a hand oriented sapient and have had a historical civilization known as the “Empire of Hands” that the Barium conquered before the Barium themselves were conquered by the Empire of Choice who were quick to integrate the Octimanians into their universal meritocracy. 

### Biology

The Octimanos are a species of octipedals, radially symmetrical beings who have eight large appendages whose "hands" function effectively as both feet and hands.  Being radially symmetrical beings, the octimanos have 360 degree vision, but eye-sight wise are rather poor.  They are three feet in height and 5 meters in diameter, being almost circular in the composure of their body.  Octimanos are to a degree, turtle-like in that they have a shell body that the eight limbs project from, with a thick, stumpy beak under them.

Octimanos, while capable of making clicking noises, express most of their complex speak using sign language, with some more vocal sub-dialects that rely on click frequency and pitch to communicate.  Octimanos have eight limbs that all have six digits.  Their languages as a result tend to be base-48.  

### Culture

Even in the face of alien conquest the Octimanians managed to retain much of their cultural thought and has a persistence in their concrete and seemingly dull mentality that not even alien contact has affected much.  While usually associated with the Aveterriat due to being a major client species of the Aveterriat, there have been Octimanians who have ended up in diasporas with most of the major factions out there either because they were abducted or because they fled the insane rigors of Vmiskii thinking hoping there may be someone else out there who is less oppressive.

Culturally octimanos are rather traditionalist, having 21500 years of history and highly ritualistic behavior. Ritualisms with the octimanos are highly frequent, as the octimanos despite having managed to build spaceships have done so out of trial-and-error, and had the luck of having cultures that were simply not aggressive and handled warfare highly ritually and formally.  Despite the advancements in chemistry and physics Octimanos have achieved, weapons of mass destruction never were used in direct conflict, instead being only used in a ceremonial fashion at worst.  Octimanos, while not technologically innovative can be a surprisingly productive species and had indpeendantly figured out magnetic launch systems around the same time as chemical rockets, and had cultures more than willing to invest in building massive launch complexes that would be painstakingly built into the terrain of the world they lived on.

Octimanos tend to colonize worlds that are most like their own, not even bothering with terraforming on their own, instead often being offered a world terraforming as part of some deal.  The octimanos were very lucky, as coming from a desert world there was always a heap of candidates to choose from and colonize.  The octimanos didn't really seem that ecstatic about contact with alien life, instead showing apathy towards the strangers.  The octimanos are not a species that is that curious of life, instead being a very pious and simple minded species.  They did however get much more defensive when threatened, however underdeveloped their warfleets were.

The octimanos have vast sums of very long winded mythologies about sedentary, eternal gods and a very naturalistic outlook on the cosmos, viewing themselves as just another part of nature.  Cooperation is a frequent theme, with the need to carry out ritual action as a given, even when it may be detrimental.  As some of the rituals do result in amputation or death.  

Octimano cultures are varied.  Though the most widespread is their hand worship.

There is a symbolism when it comes to hands, with there being a 'empire of hands' that came about, each finger representing a caste and each hand representing a sector of life that needs work.  Fulfillment through work and ritual mating seem to be ingrained into the octimanos, who tend to not care much for any activity that doesn't involve interaction with their hands.  The ships they are allowed to pilot have minimal autopilot out of basic targeting computers as a result, as hands off technology suffers severe neglect by octimanos who are given such technology.  Not due to their despise of hands off tech, but due to simply not caring for it.  It bores them to not do anything at all with their hands.
