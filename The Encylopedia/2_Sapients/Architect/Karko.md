### Overview

The Karko are a network of siliconian ammonia worlders who are much like the [[Pasis]], except with a several major differences like being energyvores to a much heavier extent- as in, they drain electronics and absorb energy easily with ammonia fueled cells.  The Karko developed a strange society on their world by the time the [[Glinnvyr]] stumbled upon them with numerous personalities vying to assimilate and eradicate the other; so that there is only one mind through a multitude of means.  There was a several dozen personalities when an ancient Glinnvyr culture conquered them.  The Karko managed to integrate with the Glinnvyr and are a major species in multiple Glinnvyr societies to this day.  The Karko have mental networks and read each otherâ€™s minds telepathically as a natural part of their existence.  The Karko are seen as living tanks and used as such by the Glinnvyr; they are just hard to destroy due to how decentralized their consciousness is and how they are able to rebuild themselves from tiny pieces.
