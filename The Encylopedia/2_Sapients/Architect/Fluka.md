### Overview

The Flukas are a highly discreet sapient who haven't really much to go on due to their slowness and living for centuries in a telepathic network.  They seem like just slow moving shell things at first glance, but their capabilities of foot tendrils and circular vision along with sonar systems make them a very potent aquatic predator.  Their larvae are way faster and tend to stick around the adults for safety.  Larvae get taught the ways from a young age, and grow into much slower, much more knowledgable beings in the oceanscape.  They don't make much use of technology, but have an incredibly rich telepathic tradition.  They exist in a water world around a K class star known as Parathala.
