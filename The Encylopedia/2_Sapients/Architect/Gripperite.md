### Overview

The Gripperites are from the world of [Sammanus](https://github.com/Insculpo/Sandbox_Galaxy/blob/Galactic/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/1_Worlds_Systems/Sammanus.md).  They had evolved in an aggressive predator-prey cycle.  Their limbs in that cycle developed tool usage with various organisms creating all matter of gel-like substances and hydrogen melding processes to make hardened gel tools.  By human standards they're huge- over ten meters in radius, but by Sammanium standards Grippers are still small.  They can't migrate northwards much, and so only a minority of their civilizations have a worldview with space in it.  They just think they exist in the balance of the universe- the balance between explosion and implosion.  Their history is not well documented, writing and preserving records is extremely hard when everything has to be stored on the relatively short lived megafauna they dig into as fortifications.  Still, they have managed a wide range of civilizations in these depths- but the barriers remain unbreakable.  They try to break them, but never can reach upwards due to impossible barrier after impossible barrier.  First there is decompression, than there is the cold- and than the very air thins out. The most advanced ones managed to figure out there is some void or vacuum out there and find this reality horrifying- to the point where the information was purged by local rulers from paranoia.  They never ceased living in superstition.
