### Evolution

The Asantum come from a Europa-like world with a rocky core the [[Architect Expanse]], icy mantle and a thin ice shell that was in a jovian moon system.  Their intelligence is the product of being a colonial organism that had to develop intelligence to make the most of their arrangement and the latent instabilities in their world caused by tidal stress from a large nearby moon that makes the regional outflows of volcanic food pumps somewhat unpredictable.  They are a higher-level predator-omnivore on their home world and like many, if not all sapients, did attain the apex predator niche remarkably fast.  The Asantum evolved their intelligence over a very long period because of mating selection between the tendrils and the need to intercommunicate their bodies in a feed-back loop which led to their modern psychology over competing minds that had too cooperate even as they competed for mates and food.  The Asantum eventually evolved to intense a mutual relationship between their aggregations that they became inseparable, however even modern Asantum can survive without some of their limbs in a savage, but ultimately defective state.  The Asantum come from creatures who millions of years ago were rooted to the ground that became free swimming entities who never closed their base roots.  Said base root found new functionality as their prehensile hands as they grew more intelligent, however the Asantum using their hands to anchor themselves to rocks in the depths of their world when they want to sit remains a common habit.

### Biology

The Asantum are abyssal beings who rely on echolocation and light patterning, along with current/volumetric disturbances that allow them to navigate the depths of their icy homeworlds.  The Asantum are colonial organisms of the same species, consisting of a central “core” which the aggregation makes a toroid around and a series of connective tissues that interlink all the tendrils that develops over time from their youth. The number of major tendrils of an Asantum can vary significantly, with some only have three while particularly massive Asantum may have dozens.

Their overall body design is arranged in a ring-like fashion where their main tendrils make up the central bulk of the ring while the fourteen secondary tendrils line the edge of said ring.  A third of these tendrils are major tendrils which hold its “brains” and act as the arms and hands for the main tendrils split into four sub-tendrils towards the tip, an atvatism from when they were but pylops that had been repurposed into being a hand.  The other 2/3rds of their tendrils are secondary tendrils primarily used for locomotion and holding stuff.  Coloration-wise the Asantum have a sea-weed like texture and come in many shades of green, with pale Asantum, dark green Asantum and brackish Asantum being the three common palettes.  In regards to variation, the Asantum are reasonably diverse.  They tend to have texturing with various patterns of light or dark streaks.  The Asantum aren’t a single species and haven’t been a single species for some time, with lots of variation in size, proportionality of tendrils and eating/mating habits having developed among their kind in the long, long time they have had civilizations.

The Asantum are very, very generalized eaters in their diets, hunting and grazing simultaneously even early on and developing a vast web of foods even in their more primitive phases of civilization.

### Psychology

The Asantum can have multiple tracks of thought occurring conterminously without any issue whatsoever. They tend to move in multiple directions and reproduce by detaching and combining two or more tendrils with other Asantum with the tendrils being capable of being autonomous living creatures themselves for a several human weeks, with “mouths” of their own that happen to also be prehensile.


### Culture

The Asantum are not terribly social creatures, living in very loose social hierarchies and being able to have the creativity to develop technological systems with fluid-based principles that have a hard time being understood even centuries into the future.  Asantum culturally are insular, with a strong independent streak and a general desire to be left alone even despite how alien help made them an interstellar species to begin with.  Given the wide breadth the Asantum exist at, spread across parts of the galaxy by both independent colonization and the colonies set up by alien empires who like having ‘niches’ filled out, there is no truly unified sense of being an Asantum, but there are strong attachments towards the abyss of ice worlds and often seek other ice worlds primarily to have more depths to occupy for the sake of spreading their kind.  The Asantum seem very aware of how lucky they were that [[The Giver]] didn’t opt to render their subglacial oceans too acidic to be inhabitable, and so have spread themselves as far and wide as possible to make their kind impossible to kill off.  

The Asantum tend to follow confederate, sector-based organizations with numerous interconnected metropoles spread across their worlds that make a social universe of their own where life is lived in often homogeneous communities (though they do have colonies that they have shared with native sapient ice worlders- the Asantum tend to be faily consistent in their lack of killing natives, being amazingly pacifistic in their approach towards conflicts in general, using violence rarely to handle situations).

Said Pacifism is noted to be more the product of how the Asantum tend to be too occupied with arguing between their limbs to ever desire making more conflict, and so tend to be much more cordial with others, even the likes of the Vmiskii Domain.  They also tend to just recluse away from any major potential conflicts before they begin.  Asantum conflicts with other species tend to be remarkably boring due to how the Asantum either commit a mass suicide or just submit without question with minimal resistance beyond perhaps, a brief civil war and even than the conquerers tend to realize the Asantum won’t defy them much as long as they feel like they are left alone even if they are being regularly extorted for slaves.  Such submissiveness has made them able to evade the usual violence of the [[Custodians]] by being fine with even the possibility of being uploaded by force one day.
