### Overview

The Aveterriat are small, highly reproductive beings around the size of a housecat when full grown who live at first what seems like a strange, unitary existence, but in truth live in a strange form of desire pursuit where work is an end of itself with deep taboos on idleness and laziness.  

### Biology

They are segmented, leathery hexapods whose sturdy limbs are all prehensile & great at climbing even in the higher gravity of [Sidilico](https://github.com/Insculpo/Sandbox_Galaxy/tree/Galactic/Stellar_Abyss_Setting_Bible/1_Worlds_Systems/Sidilico.md).  The Aveterriat have a muscular and compact form.  Their intelligence is best in groups with communal work.  The Aveterriat are rapid reproducing beings with high populations and as a result don’t have much regard for their individual lives, being all to prone to fill in their niche   They are a very rigid and process oriented species that ironically detests robots.  They have a multitude of world-states and empires around the known galaxy and have a precarious situation caused by their history being incredibly miserable in general.  Millennia spent on an arid, hostile world having to intensively cultivate in salty seas and periods of borrowing to contend with the intense flares of their parent star have led to extremely repressive societies being the norm.  

The Aveterriat reproduce in contact heavy intercourse much like us, more or less in a process of internal fertilization.  The female Aveterriat has multiple eggs within that develop into multiple sub-wombs (or purses) that enable a female to be impregnated while pregnant.  Culturally polygamy is valued over monogamy, for group raising is the norm.  This means of reproduction is why the Aveterriat are a very communal species; the idea of a single mother, single father family is just alien to their kind since the litter of a Aveterriat female may have many different fathers and a father may have many different children from many different females.  

Aveterriat eyesight is poor, but their sense of place is met by echolocation and sound just as well.  They also uniquely have a sense of density perception that is vibration based, akin to dolphin sonars.  The surface Aveterriat are known to have better eye sight than their cave counterparts but have a weaker sense of Echolocation-Interestingly both subspecies view the other one as ‘more blind’.

The Aveterriat diet consists of many meats, various mineral salts, tubular plants, salt swelling shelled sessile forms, seeds and clay along with whatever doesn't poison them; the Aveterriat aren't a terribly picky species when it comes to food.  

### Psychology

The Aveterriat perception of their world is very density centric, being able to Perceive different densities is a sense somewhat alien to humans, but common among life on [[Sidilico]].   

The Aveterriat mind is unique from humans in that it is far greater at remembering things, but abstraction is not as strong; the Aveterriat can make near perfect pictures and have since the start.  However, making stylized art of art from the imagination is considered something in the field of experts.  Humans by contrast easily make stylizations and are far more error prone in their art.  The Aveterriat tend to make sculptures from any material they can find and their whole civilization is filled with sculptures of individuals and various items of reverence and the Aveterriat have a habit of carving obsessively detailed reliefs on all their structures and vehicles, at least the ones they consider their own and not the collective's.  Stylized reliefs only became more common as the Aveterriat advanced into a more sophisticated society where more individuals could try to think in a way that could allow them to abstract their memories more.  The Aveterriat easily see the world in a naturalistic point of view and never had gods in their faith.  However, the Avaterriat are staunch believers in reincarnation and pretty much believe that the only way they die out is if their whole kind dies out.

The Aveterriat for all it is worth are quite deep thinkers, and extremely analytical.  With such intensive analytical minds, the Avaterriat would develop scientific methodologies extremely early on in their history and despite how stagnant they may seem are frequently looking deeper into their technologies to find new ways to improve on and increase the effectiveness of what they have.  

The Aveterriat emotionally have a surprising amount in common with humans for all their more exotic aspects.  
The Aveterriat get enthusiastic, frustrated, paranoid, fall into fits of lunatic rage and can be very neutral minded.  Aveterriat fear is very tied to paranoia due to being both a prey and predator species, and the Avterriat tend to strike out when scared as opposed to run when in groups.  Fear can rapidly translate to anger and fury, then back again on a moment's notice.  The Aveterriat however, tend to be happiest when carrying out work and discussing previous actions.  The Aveterriat are a social species and communicate with each other quite a bit.

The Aveterriat, despite their seemingly unitary mindset do actually have a concept of entertainment.  It just is not what humans consider that terribly entertaining in general since the Aveterriat like listening to long demonstrations of gem impurities found on an alien world or engaging in long, circular arguments that go on for weeks about the biology of an alien creature of interest.  3D video sequences of granite crumbling in slow motion has been claimed to be very arousing to a large minority of Aveterriat.  Music with the Aveterriat tends to be in terms of vibrating floors and buzz mixes.  They tend to be very methodical and have a habit of being based on mathematical patterns noticed in genome sequences, the gait of various creatures, the erosion of a rock and so on.  All of which I just said constituting whole genres really.

The Aveterriat are a sapient species and do have diversity in their mind, however it is of no doubt that at some point in their history some culture defined how space faring Avaterriat society would structure themselves for millennia to come- as current Aveterriat societies live in a system of many castes almost universally chosen by a machine AI that keeps track of what needs a colony has in terms of labor surpluses and shortages, determining the entire lives of Aveterriats based on this data.

The Aveterriat indeed do have curiosity of the world around them, and over time their quest for knowledge and absolute detail would lead them to become one of the most advanced alien societies humans know of.  It however, took them 17000 years to do so.

The different Averteriat races are very similar psychologically, however they have different inclinations in their work fetishisms thanks to their habitual upbringing in separate regions of Sidilico.

### Culture

In spite of the above inhibitions, the access to metals and the need for rapid innovation simply to survive along with a culture that sought more worlds out of fear of their dying star lead to the eventual foundation of what would become viewed as the modern Aveterriat.  The Aveterriat developmentally became extremely advanced in gravity manipulation and magnetics would fuel their industrialization instead of coal, with millennia of steel working leading to empires of hypersteels pervading their kind.  In particular, a war between two large powers in the central ocean allowed for an outside force to sweep in relatively unopposed and institute what became the modern Protectorate.  Which would become an uncompromising, totalitarian belief system which has indoctrinated their kind for nearly two thousand years.  Aveterriat colonies generally have AI systems used as a management system to enforce insanely rigid caste structures where everyone is effectively a cog in society and perpetual work for the sake of work is viewed as the aim of existence- and the purpose of life.  

The Aveterriat have machinists who are sterile and nudists who are fertile who live in near absolute segregation.  The Aveterriat, having come from a salty desert world and have dealt with punishing gravity and harsh climates for much of their existence.  So it is not a surprise to learn they are very hardy beings indeed.  They don’t dominant primarily because the Aveterriat on an interstellar scale have tended to organize themselves mostly into world states and the Vmiskii Empire is more focused on conquering their own kind than conquering aliens.  For the Aveterriat are as a species extremely kin-oriented and communal, having both male and female polygamy (for females can be fertilized by multiple males and males fertilize multiple females) and a sense of community that is often limited mostly by the cultural difficulty in sharing resources with outside groups (without coercion anyways).

The Aveterriat are obsessed with details, to extents beyond comprehension.  Toil and toil, they make endless stories describing every living being and every entity in fictional universes of which are always extremely elaborate.  Some Aveterriat spend their whole lives just reading through a couple dozen of these fictional worlds- a feat that takes centuries as the Aveterriat can live quite long when they don't die in a accident or from giving birth (only the breeders give birth thankfully).  The Aveterriat are a species who seem to exist in reality, but some degree of spiritualism still exists in numerous Aveterriat cultures, namely that of reincarnation.  Simply inheriting the memories of ancestors, so the caste systems aren't so universal as some of these cultures seek to make the absolute genii, Aveterriat that have knowledge from thousands of years aggregated through dozens of generations.  Such Aveterriat are what the Empire of Choice obsesses over, and supposed Genii in a strange turn from the typical Aveterriat cultures run things in a oligarchy, but still remain in a perpetual state of management having forgone even the Determinators beyond as monitors and surveillance to ensure all Avaterriat are at hand in their tasks.
A lazy Aveterriat tends to be killed and fed to spawn, lazy Aveterriat being seen as defective.  They have no moral qualms about Eugenics.

There are two major sets of caste in Aveterriat society, the Machinists and the Nudists.  There is far more social mobility in these castes than there is between them, the determiner may for instance make a war machinist into a constructor in more peaceful times.  The Machinist Aveterriats are Aveterriats fused into machines, becoming a totally different organism in the process and piloting extremely advanced constructs that are near impossible to crack and can gain ammo simply by collecting soot in the air.  Machinists amazingly enough are generally "sterile" in that they just can't reproduce, so instead may sometimes 'snap' and massacre Nudists in a lust filled hatred.  Sometimes this lust filled hatred is used on enemy targets to extremely deadly effect, for they are absolutely relentless and stop at nothing to want to see you reduce to gibbs all over the ground. They have numerous castes, acting as vehicles, constructors, war machines, caretakers and so forth.  Machinists tend to be diplomats as well.

The Nudists live a very different life and are allowed to be far lazier than a Machinist.  They live in massive communes and tend to be farmed by the Machinists,  as they dig the soil for minerals and herd their grazers when not slicing up the massive hundred legged megapede organisms perfunctorily.  Many nudists shockingly do live a existence of leisure- they simply make art,  carry out redundant rituals and compose simplistic rhythms- they are prone to quite frugal living even when they have freedom.  Materialism to the extent practiced by other species is near impossible to explain to them,  just as how a Aveterriat can't really explain why they have the patterns of colonization and patterns of living to humans.  They just do and the system is successful enough.  
 The Aveterriat's advancements have not really made them culturally powerful, instead they are reliant on cold, hard power in decisive actions taken when the situation calls for it.
