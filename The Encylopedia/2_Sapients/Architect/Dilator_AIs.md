# Dilator AIs
ï¿¼
Glinnvyr AI developments have incredible abilities in sheer processing speed thanks to their time dilation tech, which they have stacked with cold fusion powered processing and cold computing paradigms to make some of the fastest computers we know of.  And they integrate them into themselves or in a proxy machine.  In doing so they are able to develop probabilistic kill devices known as the Dilators who essentially will regionally distort the rate of entropy to cause disasters, erosion and metabolism to accelerate to incredible rates.  So it may cause you to get cancer millions of times over, die from heart attack instantly, starve, break machines down and so on.
