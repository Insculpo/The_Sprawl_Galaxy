### Overview

The Jayapossa are massive, sea faring sapients who sail across their oceanic world.  The Jayapossa made a civilization primarily of domesticating and incrementally altering many species of their world in a personal ecosystem that kept their kind fat and happy, and without really any way to be space faring never left their planet.  The Jayapossa are not animals- they managed written language, art and every marker of civilization by the time.  The Jayapossa have managed to be retooled into more useful species since, primarily as something to work in the seas of worlds the [[Aveterriat]] have loads of trouble with and most frequently this species is encountered on such worlds.  The Jayapossa home world is under a protection status and goes on blissfully unaware of the evils in the galaxy.  But for how long?
