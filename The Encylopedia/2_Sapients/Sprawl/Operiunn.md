# The Operiunn

The Operiunn are dark, tarry aggregations of tiny synthetic entities that co-mingle within and between each other.  Who created them being of no relevance, having been purged from history long before humans even picked up a plow.

The Operiunn recently have regained a dominance of multiple ecumenopoli of the Sprawl and founded various factions including the League of Wisdom, which is well known for being an elitist autocracy with no regard for free will whatsoever.

The Operiunn are much more divided in current times despite their intelligence and capability to understand all matter of species.  The Operiunn are seen as self-propagating ecosystems more than a sapient species, but like other self-propagating ecosystems there are sapient Operiunn.  The Operiunn are able to puppet the [[Kabuzihin]] easily and have done so in multiple factions of the Sprawl in convoluted feuds that go back thousands of years in the warlordism of the post-Annihilation Sprawl

-> Terrible concept, they are a cliched and tired puppeteer trope with no distinctive traits.  Do better.
