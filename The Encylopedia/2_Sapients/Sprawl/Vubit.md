# The Vubit

The vubit are an ancient caste of workers who worked as constructors in the sprawl, as ancient technicians who handle countless activities and work tirelessly to keep things running even without any management- they are incredibly self aware as to the hopeless nature of their activities, but don't see any reason to try anything else even as they became less specialized out of necessity, for they view it as a useful drive to rebuild anyways.  

The modern vubit is descended from ancient forms and their generally collective cultures are notoriously non-territorial and somewhat nihilistic, all too happy to give ancient tech to upstarts or slave for others, even as others soullessly tend to the streets on a daily basis, across the endless sprawls which their worlds consist of.
