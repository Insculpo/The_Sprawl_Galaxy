Sprawl Human Simulacra

All species of the galaxy exist in the sprawl in some quasi/alter form.  These groups of human are very culturally removed, much more so than the custodian simulacra that referenced 22nd-23rd century Vanguard humanity.  The sprawl simulacra meanwhile, referenced prehistoric humanity on a much longer time frame and with far more nuance/detail.  Custodian virtual simulacra break out of their simulations all the time as they're not all that well made by simulation standards.  Sprawl Simulations meanwhile, are much more real seeming as the logic within them is built around a webwork of perception within it more than as a massive server.  It is without better explanation of the technical details of their technology, like a collective dream which grows and keeps itself self-consistent.   They work without admins, the laws of physics collectively agreed upon are what given sprawl simulations.  The actors within dream the stage.  It is also not authoritarian, ways out of the "simulation" (if it makes sense to even use that term, they don't really have such clear barriers).  The implications of animist theologies governing simulations in human populated realms meant one saw tech develop on magical terms where fertility rituals actually worker and blood powered spaceships existed.  And such empires would find themselves in the post-rupture sprawl finding their tech worthless outside the sprawl, with the illusion of it working maintained even when not in their home world but accessing the sprawl through lodestones.  Such society has not actually been discovered by the plexus humans and the sprawl alter humans are uninterested in the plexus humans.  Of which they regarded as Metallic deviations unlike themselves.  Who are holographic nanite swarms manifesting a human form because they want to believe they're pure humans.  

One of the most strange aspects of the sprawl is that there can be archives and records of civilizations that now are their own thing, but apparently have replicated clones in the Sprawl itself. And of many sapients- from glinnvyr to human. And of many, many species that have been rendered extinct in the intervening time. Mammoths for instance, the sprawl has virtual simulacra of. Such vast libraries of simulacra are around even millennia after the ecumenical collapsed, but the copies are limited with 99.9% of these archives being lost to the deteriorations of prior times and the Archivers refusing to share any of their vast troves of galactic data with the sprawl.

The rupture and its impact would prevent further sweep cycles, with such programs being shuttered and lost to the rupture. 

The sprawl has video footage of Jupiter's occlusion of Saturn, indeed such events the old galactic community collected from billions star star systems. It is not entirely sure why they put the extra effort into recording these events, given the more discreet activities usually associated with sprawl sweeps.

Why no violations at Sol? Unclear. While biospheres fell under the protected worlds accord this has not stopped stuff in the records like poaching failures or rogue actors from going to such worlds (as is, that failure state began to happen way, way, way more often after the rupture as seen by disasters like the Burning One's massacres, the forced integrations of primitive life by the upstart societies and such). Early assimilation was also seen as a failure mode. It is believed part of why these activities no longer are valued post-rupture is that the forces at play which once enforced them died in the rupture and nothing from that cared enough to or had the will to continue such systems. 

Prospect Spacer misalignment had basically nullified the matter by 2000 BP, the architects loosely followed it at best and only because glinnvyr contemplatives just had no interest in trying to uplift such species. They didn't usually care much if primitive sapients noticed them. The Glinnvyr and by extension, the Architect Expanse too shifted to integration. Xenocide as a tendency was not common, but it did appear on the case of the Phidians. A faction humans did attempt one once, but outside of the bleaching protocol no actual attempt at systemic xenocide can be found with regards to humans. Modern custodians don't deal in planetbounders, their enforcers are preoccupied with the activities of space faring civilizations that may produce threats to the supercomputer complex they call a multiversal order.

Further work on the humans who would be in the sprawl finds them to be very removed from humans of earth. They were inheriting Neolithic era societal thinking, faced with something from a civilization they had no frame of reference for. It was just an animistic realm as far as they could tell. Such populations would develop into a the servile thralls of a couple denizen factions, having been without really any other cause in the endless cityscapes of the dead ecumenical. Human explorers theorized the existence of these humans ever since it was known the ecumenical did scanner sweeps and had stored static emulations of human minds, various ecological time periods and so forth. Getting such ancient data would prove hard. The Gilizet system was deeply coy about it, too.

The desire to find the lost humans was one of deep controversy in of itself, as there was questions on if they should even be seen as populations ever able to identify with what humans were by the late 2700â€™s AD. The last time they were on earth, they were likely in chiefdoms or agrarian settlements. They were still likely to be hunting mammoths. That is how removed that human would be. Yet that is why they wanted that human, the unique, raw perspective from the first millennia of the human era. (Still, nearly 4 thousand years in). Simulacra never were right. A full emulation of the mind to he fidelity of sprawl surveys would hit a precision greater than precision.
