### Overview

The Kabuzihin are hexapodal, tangerine-pale colored hive minded beings who have proliferated due to being part of the sprawl since the start and their tendency to colonize all matter of worlds regardless of habitability (they’re a very trial and error species and like making colonies anywhere they can short of lava worlds).  They are widespread, have many genetic forms due to their long history as scavenger-laborers and a frequent labor source due to their slavish behavior combined with an ease to breed.  That’s the general excuse given, anyways.  The Kabuzihin are extremely adaptable, being able tend to inhabit any world with enough oxygen, especially desert worlds.  The Kabuzihin have deviated into multiple species.  The Kabuzihin are a laid back species who seem content with their position in existence, or that of scavengers and back up labor.  The Kabuzihin infest the Sprawl to this day and are considered ‘the dominant species of the Sprawl in modern times by outsiders mockingly.

### Biology

The Kabuzihin come in large numbers and tend to work better in groups than alone, with their various organic castes (soldier, king, queen, worker and caretaker).  They only reproduce from their queens, who have symbolic authority, but in practice it’s more the soldiers who take care of all the political matters while the queen and king spend all their time breeding and barely have sapience.  The soldiers have some sapience, but even they seem dumb to humans individually.  The caretakers are generally the ‘smartest’ individually, and do at times run the hives often in conflict with the soldiers.  The caretakers are able to translate languages the best, but even they are slaves to their role in the hive as basically nurses.  

The Kabuzihin are found in huge numbers within the Sprawl and other parts of the galaxy, having made pale imitations of the civilization that has come before.  Kabuzihin are not insectoids, their grey external limbs and extremely thick fat layers covering their main body put them in a classification that really defies Terran classification.  The Kabuzihin make huge geometric hives using their own vomited ‘hard fat’ and structure their cultures around these hives that tend to be mountainous in size.

### Psychology

Collectively they’re not a stupid species (they’re quite organized and adaptable), but they are very conservative minded and without large aggregations fall into mindlessness.  The hive is the most important unit to their kind, not the family.  Each hive is like an individual, the Kabuzihin will frequently refer to themselves as just another number in their hive as they aren’t really given names, with the hive being as they identify themselves.  The personas of these hives can however, vary radically from each other and this is where much of their divisions happen.
