# The Iffip

The Iffip are serpents not related to the Dioviermes found in the Sprawl whom have evolved and adapted themselves to the sewer systems of the Sprawl.   They are incredibly self centric, especially their rulers.  They were once critters who had the niche of pets and sewer cleaners and still they rule the depths of the Sprawl before being augmented into full on synthetic beings.  In the post-collapse sprawl, the Iffip have attained control of the levers of power within the under-Sprawl.  Subsequently having made a secret police network of multiple species along with their own hovering and nanite based tool manipulation systems.    

They are cloistered from [[Operiunn]] activities mainly due to having been constructed in the upper Sprawl and not the lower Sprawl.  They also have no space craft instead making use of ancient node systems they guard rigorously and obsessively keep energized in order to keep their interstellar, yet planet bound existence going.  They know of space, but see it of no value compared to the treasure troves of resources the inner Sprawl has lying around.  

They tend to shroud themselves in jewelry, gold holding and all matter of impractical dressing to show their luxurious position as the masters of the depths.  They have no eyes, as they have no need for them, instead using sonar systems and a extremely strong echolocation to see basically everywhere.  Hiding from them is hard, for this echolocation is enhanced through a vast range of sensory systems and even incredibly subtle variations they can determine as something distinct.
