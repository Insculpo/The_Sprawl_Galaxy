# The Folding Ones

ï¿¼
The folding ones are an entity evidently related to the Dioviermes that is stationed in the depths of the Ancient Ecumene.  They are a form of synthetics dead set on the concept of density and information density, with their nano-civilization sprawling across dozens of light years yet containing the information of a universe, if you are to believe what is known of their incredible information dense existence.  The folding beings have made use of hyperspatial means to achieve this density, to which they claim they hold a planet a millimeter.  And a civilization within the space of a tennis ball.  

They networked them all, at the fidelity of reality itself to create ultra-complexity and the foldminds who emerged as a result of billions of co-interacting entities and these foldminds became the folding beings, large leviathan, spaceship sized you paper thin entities whose behaviors are built off the thoughts of quintillion's of foldites, sapient microscopic beings who exist only within the fold and exist at a far faster time pace as they miniaturized themselves further to the "subverses" where they believe paradise can be found.  That is a convergent cultural trend, this desire to dig and dig in exploration.  Some do find a way out of the folders, only to find a universe of overwhelming scale.  They believe our universe too, may be fragmented into some even greater being.  

They are also notorious for their conflicts with the Archivers, who they steal data from and harass all over the galaxy.  Their microscopic spaceships appearantly hitch rides to the sprawl from other larger scale ships and spread from there, to the point they are taking data from the scavenger civilizations of the outer galaxy or would, if they didn't have to figure out what primitive ass formats they're using first.
