## Overview

The Marata are sapients who came from a gas giant who have been found throughout the Sprawl and Ancient Ecuemene seemingly disconnected from each other.  The marata’s existence is that of pain, for the Marata continue on their endless task of making and making new materials from rich resources within a jovian planet only they can access so consistently.  They are a metamorphic species and are very hard to even communicate with, let alone understand.  The marata regardless have become a notable alien species due to the Sprawl’s widespread use of them and their continued operation even in the collapse of the Sprawl.  The Marata are like giant balloons with a radial symmetry and many small limbs.  They are massive beings on the order of the Ikeitos in size as well.

### Psychology

The Marata mind is all too built around vastness, a vast scattering of mind which allows them to be intelligent only in some phases of their lives while being almost mechanical in nature in others, these phases being domesticated by the phases of intelligence among the Marata to ensure a stable society.  Their massive minds mean they are able to just keep thinking many tasks out at once, a useful adaptation brought about by their many tendrils and incredibly complex body design which emerged from billions of years of living on a stormy and hellish world.  Marata therefore have been mistaken for animals on numerous occasions, especially when you encounter their instinctive killing machines that is the third phase Marata.

First Phase; Larval phase which live on defensive phase marata.

Second Phase; Wisdom phase (they are most intelligent when they are changing, they make radical alterations in this phase that has led to this phase being referred to as a ‘cocoon phase’.  This phase tends to be protected by later phases.

Third Phase; Defensive Phase, keeps track of the first two phases, can’t reproduce yet however.  Care for the weak, defend from the monsters.  Defensive phase Marata are “female” biologically, as they give birth to new Marata.

Forth Phase; Clever Phase, the second major ‘intelligence’ part of their life.  Some memories retained from earlier lives, many having fled in the third phase.  The idea of body with the marata is that the soul does not preeminently inhabit bodies, only occupy them for fleeting moments of time.   

Fifth phase; Reproductive phase, the last phase- Marata will reproduce and beyond this point slowly wither away with age, the younger marata handling the parenting/raising of new generations.  These pretty much breed with phase 3 marata indirectly as “male” Marata.
