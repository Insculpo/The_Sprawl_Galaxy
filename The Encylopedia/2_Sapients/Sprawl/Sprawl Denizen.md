**Dioviermes**


The [[Diovierme]].  The god worms. They are the first movers, their presence has been known in many shapes and forms. The sprawl being the most notorious. Their kind used to reside over a galactic civilization, one which collapsed in the rupture.

The Dioviermes are basically segmented sapients that are immortal beings who split to make more of themselves. It is not sure when they started that way, as even the devolved forms of their kind that aren't energy serpents shifting form at a whim show those traits. Many Dioviermes exist, with their kind often seen as the minds behind the sprawl, Archivers and verdancy. They are ancient beings who have traversed the galaxy, their distant cousins in the andromeda are far less understood and why they never invaded the Milky Way in the millennia since even less so, but the estimate of 15 millennia to get to the Milky Way or simply some pact with other powers that be could factor. Many sprawl Dioviermes are imbued into the systems of the sprawl itself, of which are everywhere.


ï¿¼

The endlessness of their form is due to their immense age, growing with time and wisdom, often the branch of other longer parts of the body.

In the modern sprawl they're still amazingly common, but often in the depths and confided with lost memories and sense of time . They wander often obliviously, still at times picking up on the reality of their universe.

And it shall now be noted the sprawl is rather "slow" technologically, but this didn't stop a rapid tech ascension with sapients like the lost harlapans and the extinct Quvakers

When we have sought to understand them what we have instead found was... an abyss of space and time. So much of their records have been ominously stripped out of the canon of ecumenical existence. Replaced with a repetitious drive- to build the galactic ecumenical, to make a galactic society, that the progress to that is the highest achievement. And that they have achieved it- the light against a universe of incomprehensible darkness. A beacon defiant. We can't say what exactly against- the records speak of hostile entities known as the [[Tarpoids]] who fester the cosmos. We can't say if they even existed. Only that they were not why the rupture happened. The rupture's cause is still unknown. But it had no markings of extragalactic invasion. We would not be around if so. We would have seen more systemic destruction. It would have been intergalactic conflict. Instead we just see a rupture in both the records and the structure. 

Wormholes collapsing in the droves. Godlike beings carrying out murderous rampages across untold stars before committing suicide in vast arrays of death- the sad disturbing revelation of the Crab Nebula is just that. What a reveal that could be. But even that, a small part of a grander galactic enigma. Regional fragments, the violence is evident. The cause less so. Made worse by the survivors having turned so insular, so unapproachable. So hostile to outside contact. And so lost in a purgatory of incomprehensible degeneration of mind, spirit and soul that millennia flew by past them. And that they let us even exist is due to that indifference to our rise. They just see it as a curiosity. Not something to bring to the fold, nurture from the savagery like they once did. They were fine letting us die. 

They were fine letting the fosskemians nuke themselves. They were fine letting humanity fall to totalitarian regimes. They were fine with the architect nearly activating one of their leftover WMDs at the expense of their continued existence. They don't care much about us. And they never had to. They are indifferent to us as we had been to animals suffering Darwinian struggles on earth even as post scarcity conditions were theoretically achieved.

For ultimately we arise in a galaxy without much cause. We had arisen without much at all. We had arisen without much a care in the universe, content in our supremacy over earth we had not realized our own infancy in any galactic term. That was an error taken well into the future and even after the catastrophic Vanguard era. We just had to keep persisting.

**Kimmur**

The kimmur are a denizen group of that have mostly spent the millennia handling millions of problems in their small part of Karbana kinnis arising from the pale societies and the tensions between other such groups. They are an assembly of shape shifters like many denizen groups where life is one of just flow. Many don't even really have identity, Kimmur is the name of the sprawl district they congregate more than a self given name. They have been countless species in vast times, experiencing through the backlogs of countless surviving archived worlds stored away as their experience oriented kind has broken with most material concerns beyond deterrence of the other denizen groups who have not gone to the distances they did. Much of this is hard to fully process as a human, to them awareness and self aren't even things much less time. So they have been doing this even before the ecumene was lost. They have proven hard to integrate, preferring to be lost in their endless experience of flowing states. Their original automata unlike most still fulfill the original goal of keeping the other forces away, even in the chaos of the rupture. Indeed this kimmur group was a lucky one, many such flowing denizens were wiped out in the rupture and events since.

**The Tilundites**

The Tilundites are found in the dead market. They are notable as beings who basically are of lost origins? Hard to say, they were known to likely have been a client of the Ecumenical once. They're not easy to process mentally given that they are effectively a crusted force, full of embroidery that make up their opulent substrated chitin. They come in obscene, obscene numbers in the present and usually appear in waves, where they flood multiple sprawl worlds before diffusing back into the mists. When they swarm, they collect, they just are a flood of encrusted crablike things, flooding across vast amounts of constructed urban landscapes, climbing into walls, on buildings and such. They are more seen as a periodic nuisance by the locals, but can be dread inducing for outsiders unfamiliar with their ways. When the Tilundites are done with a swarm sweep, trader Tilundites emerge instead where they often are willing to trade some of what they have harvested in exchange for something they are interested in having from you. These traders often are operating for centuries until any that Tilundite sweep happens. They like to trade with outsiders least concerned with the consequences of giving Tilundites what they want. There is no clear end game with Tilundites, they seem to just want survival and aggregation of rare minerals more than anything else. What their role was during the ecumenical is one of contention, the locals know them mostly as something that even when the ecumenical was around were irritants. That there is no ecumenical didn't make them suddenly more a pest beyond it being much harder to defend against the sweeps without the resources of a linked galactic civilizations. They appearantly had jobs making elaborate jewelry for regalia at one point, indeed the traders they send out may even try to get you to trade for that instead of something more practical. But with the rupture they shifted culturally to wanting to be that regalia, that glitzy glittery chitin. A vast ocean of riches.


**Operiunn**

The questions of what the [[Operiunn]] truly stand for has remained a mystery to this day, as they are known for being basically ascended nanite blobs who shapeshift into many forms linked to a higher alpha mind that they defer to. Many seem to insist on the idea the sprawl can be theirs once more and unlike the Dioviermes who make attempts to reach out of the sprawl occasionally, the Operiunn seem far more wedded to the remnant sprawl. They claim to even be the ones who built large swaths of it, which has some bearing given how their nanites are a common sight throughout the sprawl. They are the most "humanoid" remnant sprawl sapients in some ways, given their shape shifting forms often allow them to manipulate and adjust to many different sapients with interest in outsiders highest among their groups.

**Kabuzihin**

The Kabuzihin were Eusocial sapients at some point, they had become fully automata despite retaining their eusocial hive structures. As per the sprawl standard they became substrate and despite having similar shape shifting keep to role castes of caretaker, protector, queen, drone, and worker within hive states. The synthetic substrate seemed to just expand their nature as their bulbous forms mixed and merged. Swarms of them fester about, living and clashing with automata very often due to post collapse kabuzihin having just absurdly vast quantities of their kind within the deep layers of the sprawl. The kabuzihin are mostly known for their iconic masks.

-**Calzonin**

The Calzonin are strange for being hairy/fuzzy entities who show little coherent purpose. They usually emerge as vine-like strands of moss and fuzz, they grow absurdly massive in how they seem to be like a moss which grows over sprawl structures as fuzzy colonial beings. They seem to see their own kind as smart, but they seem to more be like a the puppet tools of their nanite carpets that spread wherever they go, along with [[The Clouds]].

-**Barca**

The Barca are spaceship sized entities who appear almost as blimp-like structures in the layers of vast sprawl. They are coated in thick membrane layers and have no real species known they were based on beyond their absorbing of heat dissipation and dissolution into other sprawl forms. Indeed they are believed to be how sprawl entities come to be born. They host many sub-cavities which can rapidly fill with defensive vehicles flicker consciousnesses handle. They seem to be very smart but their conscious existence is a weak temporal one even shorter than today. T
