### Evolution

The Dioviermes are serpentine aliens with segmented bodies and trilateral symmetry.   They are from humid world with perpetual cloud cover broken only by the dry seasons and highly mountainous landscapes. It is a world with little gravity, a factor which would affect their evolution greatly as it allowed them to be gliders rather easily.  This misty world is a very warm, hazy world whose hydrosphere is more like numerous, interconnected seas than continents and oceans.  Such environment proved a great incubator of biodiversity on their world with its 40% landmass.  Diovierme evolution was not as slow as one would think, mainly since their mitosis and asexual reproduction is helped by basic darwinian logic and mutations cuased during growth of new body parts.

Of the many families of organisms of their world, the Dioviermes come from a segmented, trilaterally symmetrical family of arboreal creatures.  Unlike with humans, the Dioviermes never stopped being arboreal, in fact they evolved into the direction of being gliders to take advantage of the weak gravity of their world.     

### Biology

Dioviermes are arboreal beings, capable of gliding and swinging or dwelling about in the sides of cliffs.  The Dioviermes have a trilateral symmetry and reproduce by mitosis.  The Dioviermes consist of multiple species, though only the larger dioviermes attained true sapience initially.  The Dioviermes have a long, rigid brush-like probiscus and have an exoskeleton with three large curved ridges per segment from which protrude their limbs.  Between these ridges are long, fin-like appendages which enable their gliding. The Dioviermes don't have any actual orientation, often being able to be vertical, horizontal or curved as needed.

The specialized segments of a Diovierme can become more Diovierme given enough food and time, but intelligence requires a larger Diovierme (Dioviermes with just a couple segments tend to have just a animal-like intelligence).  The Diovierme have trilateral symmetry down their cylindrical body, with their limbs taking different tasks depending on how much food they can attain.  Arms with hands can only exist with well fed Diovierme, less well fed Diovierme use their limbs as legs only and starving Diovierme are reduced to slithering about like snakes, shedding away their limbs to preserve energy and existing in an animal-like state.  

Dioviermes can grow indefinently in theory, though are hampered in practice by nutrition and the square cubed law.  In structured society, you tend to see much larger dioviermes because they live much longer and get much more food (and need much more food).  

The more primitive Dioviermes have been noted as reliant on detecting movement to catch prey, sensing vibrations and changes in air pressure along with sound.  It would seem the Diovermes have naturally poor eyesight, perhaps due to the fogginess of their worlds.  Their sense of sound remains remarkable however.  As they tingle about using their gliders as sensory equipment attuned very sensitive to changes in the air, they are always aware of where their targets may be.

For itâ€™s harder for them to breathe in less humid, less dense atmospheric media.  

### Psychology

Diovierme psychology is deeply influenced by how variable their intelligence and identity can become thanks to their form.  Or in short, because they get better at remembering things and processing information as they grow bigger, being cut is deeply traumatic unless it is on their own volition to reproduce they must divide themselves to make a new Diovierme.  This dilemma for the self-aware Dioviermes has led to all matter of cultures dealing with reproduction quite differently, some always dividing by the middle, others seeing the need to cut one segment and let it grow as critical to some cycle, others with all matter of strange rituals for where one should slice themselves as a form of self-sacrifice for the greater good.  Others still view it as an inevitable punishment.  

### Cultural Foundations  

The nature of Dioviermes is pretty much entrenched in how they hold memory and the strong desire to hold onto an identity, and the inherent contradiction that comes with how they must reproduce.  It is to the point where there are Dioviermes who consign themselves to never reproduce.  Of course, cultures dominated by such Dioviermes simply do not last.

The Dioviermes tend to be remarkably social, usually with the biggest Dioviermes (being deemed the wisest) as the group leaders.  The general social order is very much entrenched in relations to memory and often Dioviermes in a group have a common memory of events stretching back many generations due to memories being retained every generation of mitosis.
