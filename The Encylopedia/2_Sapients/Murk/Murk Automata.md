￼
Blank prospectors are a tikali invention, they are smart machines who act as middle managers to prospecting resources in dry regions and tend to prefer to root themselves into the ground.  Blank prospectors have been well known for their dull, determined seriousness that characterizes the usual assigned personalities of these blank prospectors of the tikallian mush.  Their rooting into the ground allows them to sense a vast range of vibrations and uncover density fluctuations underground.  Such sensory apparatus allows the blank prospectors to find all matter of strange anomalies in the world.  Be it the locations of underground bases or the discovery of some massive store of a rare earth mineral.  Blank prospectors aren’t often called on much by their clan, but all clan masters return to them due to have rooted they have gotten in tikallian societies.  Blank prospectors have found usage and work by numerous other societies besides the tikali, especially human societies who tend to personalized them with more human-like faces and emoting.  The pictured blank prospectors is one such example of a blank prospectors adapted to human usage.


# Livid Industrialists

The livid industrials are industrial automata who make the templates the tikali design and are trotted out whenever repairs are to be made to the plasteel abominations tikali call spaceship engineering.  They are known for having a livid temperament because they are always frustrated and angry with everything they come across, but this anger makes them focused and able to get the job done with interlopers getting punished.  They are not nearly as sophisticated in their awareness as the [[Jama]] or such, nor able to operate on such scales and iterative action.  Really they're not anymore advanced than human robotics, in some ways a bit behind even given the animalistic degrees of capability they are constructed to.  They are not the Great Blue, needless to say.  But livid industrialists were deployed there.

# Depressed protectors

Depressed protectors are in some ways a workaround on revenge cycles, they kill and expect to die after killing.  That is why they are rather depressive for an automata.   Depressed protectors work on what they do because they are automata who do so.  This is a constant.  They make use of vacuum tube cannons due to being aquatic but, where vacuum tube weaponry is more practical due to the pressure differentials.  The superheated stream of fluid within the spaceships also means not using hull piercing kinetics.  Hollow projectiles and such also can help with that, but those tend to be used with air stations.
