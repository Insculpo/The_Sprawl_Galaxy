## Biology

Physically the Natvyr are moderately sized, coffee brown and fuzzy warm blooded tetrapodal creatures from cold planets who use their trunks to manipulate their environment around them.  The unstable conditions of their worlds have wrought them have made their whole physiology something that shifts with the climate.  They are a poisonous species,  whose hair is toxic to the touch and are among the larger hive minds, reaching the size of a deer.  Which by their home world’s standards evidently is small.

## Psychology

The Natvyr are a hive mind species with queens, drones and workers.  Despite being a hive mind, the workers reproduce with the drones all the time and the queen’s power is in her ability to reproduce a lot faster and hold a form of mind control to all Natvyr in her presence (chemically, anyways).

Incidently the Utanguis when they arose saw the Natvyr as their greatest enemies, but managed to destroy the Natvyr in their region quite effectively.  The Natvyr have resurged elsewhere as of late, with very volatile and disorderly hives cropping up in the past couple thousand years.  The Natvyr are less rigid than you would expect from a hive mind and can function as individuals much better than other certain hiveminds.

The Natvyr are a traditional hivemind that is straight up eusocial, as the common Natvyr has no real sense of
individuality, but the queens and drones do show individualistic traits.  Instead they all are like parts of some greater organism and act as such.  But the Natvyr are extremely self-contradictory, for their higher order minds still have some degree of individual thought in them.  This is noticeable in workers who habitually collect certain items for aesthetic reasons, but is most noticeable in the drone and queen castes.  

Natvyr may also end up losing their overall connections, the “degenerative” Natvyr having individual thought to some degree, but only to a 4th grader’s level from a human perspective.

Natvyr drones tend to be single minded sex addicts stereotypically, but also have control over many hive functions and in a way act as a middle class of Natvyr society with all matter of Drones specializing in technical and logistical functions with a strong tendency towards experimentation.  It is these drones who are a major factor in why their species became space faring- some of the larger aggregations wanted to have their own planet independent of the others and so experimented a lot with space travel.  

## Culture

The Natvyr gained an increasingly modern civilization as a byproduct of these ventures, developing a space faring civilization whose military never evolved beyond ballistic weaponry (they amassed lots of fission based missiles, like enough to blanket the surface of Jupiter many times over in nuclear hellfire).

Natvyr queens tend to be similar minded, but arbitrarily demand a “loyal king drone” at all times in many cases.  Mind you, said queens and kings are not like human kings of queens.  They have no real contact or clue how the hive at large is behaving, only the intuition of needs the super organism has.  Growth, Defend, Attack, Horde, Build and so on.

Natvyr due to how fast they reproduce and live lack any parental convictions, and with rapid reproduction rates due to workers and drones being able to make children together baby Natvyr end up being used as biomass they can sell to outsiders for better defense systems or as a first line of back up should food sources go dry, if not simply as a means of population control.
