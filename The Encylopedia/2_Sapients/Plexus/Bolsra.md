# Bolsra

The bosra family of machines is deeply intertwined in the cult of sal and the open twirls of the ice giant which they live around as a drone swarm.  They are of human origin and are service machines made by the cult of sal during the Aveterriat wars with the primary purposes of prospecting and soldier morale, against other human beings.  The Aveterriat weren't even aware of this development and seemed to not even be aware the cult of sal saw them in reference, they just saw more people who needed to be punished for their attacks on the Reaches.  In the aftermath, the Bolsra have since achieved a high standard of existence living around methane rich environments and generally being energy averse and preferring a low power life style making use of orbital motion regularly to conserve and sticking together as a neural-linked group.
