## Overview

The Parda are tribalistic segmented creatures from a world known as [[Qualma]].  The Parda haven't much concept of life or death, being more inclined towards fragmented livelyhoods within capricious spaces.  The Pardan outlook is built from their rigid world, with its dense plastic-like flora and its sprawling wastes amid the few regions life is capable of thriving.  Pardan existence had based itself around a tubular format, with their life style oriented around questions of the higher order they had convened themselves a part of.  In the depths of their sect, so much had lost purpose.
