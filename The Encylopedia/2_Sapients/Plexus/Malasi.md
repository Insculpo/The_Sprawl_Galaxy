## Overview
ï¿¼
The Malasi are a civilization of brush filled creatures who dwell mainly in swamps.  Their civilization do to speak is a huge colonial system of fibers they feel about the place, thriving mainly as components of a network of "flora" on their world.  The Malasi are highly violent and aggressive towards everything not themselves and make use of very stingy systems of harm to achieve what they want- that is, the death of outsiders.  The Malasi lack much in the way of tools and exist more or less are colonial drifters so to speak- loose colonials who have no sense of identity or consciousness, but collectively act as something alive and able to do incredible acts of cleverness due to their spontaneous ability to "burst" into logical paths which give them the solutions to issues built on sudden information surges from local flora.
