# Virtual Minds
ï¿¼
Virtual minds are a Plexus phenomena, mainly caused by the collective minds which make up their whole system and the post-living populations of immortals who collectively control everything.  Virtual spirits are Emergent minds within the system who are a collage of thousands of other minds which creates a new individual which should not exist.  This virtual spirit menace has been one of the main factors for why the initial bond between the [[Grand Assembly]] and [[Virtue Coalition]] collapsed, mainly due to the inability to manage or do away with these emergent beings who refused to die unless the networks got severed.  

The digital spirits in time would have a real world presence as well, in their utterly alien creation and outlook.  Imagine as if you came to being with the memories of thousands of lives from nothingness and every time you thought, thousands of solutions to the same thing came to your head and this overwhelming information was something you could only handle by being completely and absolutely impulsive in behavior.  That should give but a small idea of why they are so chaotic by nature and so devastating to the virtual network which purgatory had developed, even if the spirit epidemics could be quarantined in many cases.
