**The Synthetic Flesh**

A people of Augmented flesh and bones with lots of synthetic parts, layered up with cybernetic exoskeletons. They wear what we'd call power armor like clothing. They enter a vehicle powered by americium, becoming that vehicle. They fly out to another continent within the second layer of the Mckendree cylinder to discuss the current weather control dispute. Much to their frustration they have to be physically present thanks to some arcane rules to founder of the cylinder set, telepresence can sometimes have the problem of identity theft. Being physically present was seen as less probable for that just since there's a lot more metrics to directly reference. The weather control dispute is plainly put, inane. The uplifted whales keep insisting on tides but other groups (mainly some wetware hippies) don't want the damn tides. The cyborg sides with the whales, because they hate the wetware hippies and think their furry asses getting drenched would be funny. The AI census agrees. (I have no idea why I wrote this, just was trying to imagine some stuff)
Cybernetic Modulus

*Vanguard Era cybernetics*

The oldest cybernetics in use to this day have centuries of history. From the first bionic arms and prosthetics of pre-vanguard civilization to the full body telepresence androids of the 22nd century, the field of cybernetics in the 22nd-23rd century amplified in its scope and progress in the cybernetics spring.

Much of this can be seen in the [[Vataland]] based Anterka Bionics company, where full body replacement was first achieved in experiments that went above and beyond the fray of what augmentation codes allowed. BMI cyborgs were seen as more acceptable than the BCI cyborgs, of which didn't center the human brain and didn't open the mind uploading specter or the psychological complications of old BCI mechanisms. BMI industrial workers became a common sight in the colonies where such tech was loaned out from the inner colonies and easier to make than the more sophisticated AI controlled builders, of whom usually needed instructor agents anyways.

Eventually the costs of even BCI cybernetics and multipurpose automata got much lower. This coincided with the fall of the Vanguard and the warring factions

*Warring Factions period cybernetics*

The collapse of the Vanguard meant the experiments with transhumanism and posthumanism accelerated to once unthinkable degrees. A Cambrian explosion of technological clades emerged in the violence of a humanity that had given up on the old Vanguard dream of a united humanity colonizing the galaxy. [[The Vanguard]] lacked the flexibility or understanding of the galaxy's true to manage that, indeed the inequalities of transhuman and posthuman factions were vast and the Plexus was but a fragmented mess which integrated BCI to the virtual life. Elaborate super soldier power suits connected to humans were developed, the much of which came from the pressure of intruding prospect spacers seeking more rapid tech development of the human. Cybernetics and augmentation became dirt cheap with fabricators and widespread expertise with fitters (people who manage and guide the fitting of cybernetics onto others) as a job cheap and widespread, leading to quite a bit of chaos all around.

**The Hyperhuman**

A clade of humans who used genetic augmentation to achieve the perfect human form, these clades have their origin in very conservative groups who saw the advancing posrhumanism as a challenge. They challenged the gender norm shifts especially, pushing instead for augmentation that accentuated gender roles to the point of them becoming biological castes with extremely powerful muscular supermen and women who were given as perfect proportions and form for what was regarded as beauty to their minds. Things identified Mental disorders were aggressively pruned, including autism, cyberpsychosis and gender dysphoria. The point was to make people "normal" again as they saw it. However in the process they made a clade of people who found the vanguard too far for them, they didn't value universal humanity- to them the superiority of the hyper had to be preserved. Such clades eventually evolved into the demigod caste of The Estate, which fell due to the posthuman soldiers of the Grands Assembly who didn't en masse cull traits in a fascistic drive for perfection.  

*Plexus Age cybernetics*

The Plexus is vast. The unimaginable amount of thinking, simulation and experimentation done means huge leaps and bounds in the manipulation of conciousness itself occurred. This was seen with the cybernetics as well, post-cybernetics as a form of cybernetics emerged. Basically people so cybernetic and machine that they can't be meaningfully called cyborgs anymore. More akin to extremely retrofitted and enhanced machines with the atavistic mind of a biological being. BCI hives, neural tribes and advanced agents ended up as the dominant triad of clades. 97% of the human population by 2800 are heavily modified by cybernetics, it is seen as a violation of basic liberties in the bulk of plexus connected volumes to go without them.

These cybernetics include the following machinery

**Ossified Chromium**

Cybernetic skeletons are indeed a part of the universe, these clades appeared from people who rejected the fake prosthetic skin exteriors of the past seeing them as uncanny valley and in general an unappealing lie. They started as a counter cultural movement in the wake of the Vanguard's fall and was very much a techno barbaric aesthetic at the time. Basically during the time of the Vanguard cybernetics were hidden whenever possible behind artificial skin layers to maintain the illusion of there being humans. These skin layers were dispensed with in favor of more metallic layers and a shameless display of the hardware humans were becoming. Such people don't come cheap, but remain a notable population within the Plexus. They constantly are having to cool themselves down, they even drink coolant instead of water.
