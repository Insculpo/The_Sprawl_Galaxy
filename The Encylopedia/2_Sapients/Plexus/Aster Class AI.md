The Asters are a systems management AI system that exists as a stabilizing agent, something that was in severe need in the chaos of the warring factions period.  They controlled various bureaucratic clusters of servers, as the more autonomous descendants of the blue world initiatives of the Vanguard.  Asters deal in automated law enforcement and construction automata, with the goal of being the incorruptible enforcers of the legal codes whatever the operant route to that is based on what the judicial unions have determined.  This can include guerrilla methods against an invading force, as their clear cut dominions of city sectors state.  

Aster AIs would by the 2700's be a prominent, powerful force as more methods and functions got unloaded onto them and such systems were basically used on the cause they are perfectly impartial arbiters of justice.  There is no blinder justice than the justice of Asters who supposedly cared not of your wealth, background or anything.  They just cared for the facts, the evidence given and the legal codes in how they do handled it.  The Aster Judgement is notorious in how it gives nobody a break.  Indeed the Aster Judgment is seen as the core deal, not the final judgement which the proper arbiters and telepresent concensus can modify based on additional contextual realities with the subject and situation at hand. 

Asters were not just used for legal applications, as they have found roles in a wide range of industries due to their organizational functions.
