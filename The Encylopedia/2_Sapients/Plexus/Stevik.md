The Stevik were contacted in 2578 by the Regnant's frontier survey probes that later sent an expedition to the Scaverkan system. The chaos of the Regnant-Consortium war at home cut them off from the main body.

The Stevik were like the [[Ikirmite]], studied and abducted to plant colonies of them in other worlds for specialized work on worlds humans struggle with even with cybernetics. Indeed cybernetics on an ikirmi or Stevik make them even better in those niches faster than cybernetic humans made to better thrive there, the built in psychology, traditions and behavior are just better for it.


In that state the expedition had orbited the sun, the main world seen as too hostile to deal with even compared to the deserts and savanna of other worlds.

The world was full of life but they had kept a distance, pending orders to not land there with activity mostly being in the setting up of an asteroid colony and having local activities at a nearby ice giant.

Probes sent to scaverkus were known to not return. Local fauna was actively destroying them, with a disturbing degree of coordination that at first glance made little sense.

It was in 2591 that contact would be formally made, a unilateral action by a faction of the expeditionary society that had the paranoid belief the local world was reverse engineering their tech. A not too inane paranoia given what had transpired with the ikirmi and how the secrecy was believed already lost due to them managing to take out probes, which tried to be stealthy but somehow the local fauna figured out their presence. They had even managed to adapt their detection methods to see other regnant stealth drones.

They captured those drones, so an idea was hatched to make a drone that could see even after being captured. The Present for [[Scaverkus]] as it was whimsically known.

The present found an extensive as all hell cave network, more so than what the first surveys had found with kilometers of deep networked ecologies. The population of the world was greatly underestimated, while the extent of the networks was something seismology guessed to be loosely kilometers, the extent to which activity went on that deep was severely underestimated. Those caves were presumed natural. They weren't. The vast subterranean lakes and aquifers that seasonally built up had work from the geysers, the many cavernous layers and so forth. The upper seasonal changes were ventilation systems for continent spanning underground ecosystems dug out by the Stevik over the millennia.

They didn't seem like much in the way of a technological civ, so used to the local ecologies of their world they modified that instead of doing advanced tools. They had spears and harpoons, they had fire, but never seemingly developed metallurgy. Instead they made a kind of ceramic boney substance they spread about the place, to strengthen the integrity of regions of the caverns, geoengineer geysers and hunt when the middle season was around.

Some of the remnant had gone mad on seeing this, it just psychologically tortured them how different something could exist, thrive and be on a world that was as hostile as Scaverkus.

Interaction with the locals began more, but it was hard. It took years of attempts, of which by 2603 was complicated by the Regnant's downfall and the founding of the [[Grand Assembly]] had sent vessels to the area and condemned their overt contact activities. Another Ikirmi was dreaded, so contact terms couldn't be allowed to be dictated by a middle manager force like a straggler expedition group. The Scaverkan system would be made a system do the Grand Assembly and given autonomy. A similar act had occurred with the Ikirmites and the panic of the Foundation Massacre had led to desire for softer gloves in general, no one truly knowing what to expect from the custodians and the golden swarm led to a general wariness of aliens even as humans were dealing with species not capable of the mass destruction space travel allowed for. The fear was more of the potential of such development. **[[Tikali]] had been stripped from the timeline, so in this world the prior double example doesn't exist. Humans have cold terms with other species, not just due to cybernetics either**.

The fight between the consortium and Grand Assembly nearly spread into the Scaverkan system, as consortium probes had been in that system to study [[Scaverkus]] on their own terms with abductions/DNA sampling being aggressively carried out in 2585 onwards. The local regnant had done similar but didn't do so with the same sloppiness. Intercepting them was tough due to tech parity and agreements made prior on the matter, agreements the Grand Assembly would nullify and cause an expulsion of Consortium entities from the system.

The Scaverkus entities would manage to board spaceships in 2610 or so, with the Grand Assembly supplying such spaceships due to a loose system of resource symbiosis being achieved with that Stevik population. Other Stevik groups were more hostile and pinned away, managing to use tech trade from rogue actors in the Instability of the early Grand Assembly to get a loose deterrence system going. Their use of tech was not normal, they were fine with using multiple species to man a single thing one human was enough for and often cross integrating it with the ecology in rusty ways. The phenomena was seen as charming by romanticists. It was a humiliating result to the Xenodiplomacy division however, as upstart species getting human tech was not desirable even if they clearly couldn't reverse engineer it beyond a loose integration of the black box tech. Even still, the rogue humans and AI that were helping them made things worse. Not as bad as they got on the multi species world experiment gone rogue system state that was [[Vurmaria]] but still, the workings of the phenomena had been incubating.

The Stevik exported to worlds like [[Vurmaria]] or Caeli's industrial belt had proven adaptable when allowed to bring their ecology with them, they just managed to retool it. The arrangements with Stevik were segregated, simple arrangements. They gave minerals and resources they mined, they get to have a colony. A leased colony in many regards. The system of colonial leasing with aliens has been criticized as exploitative despite its advocates claiming mutualism. The stench of segregationist thought was seen as filling the whole deal, but the reality of the aliens being so different from humans to the point of needing different ecologies was a hard reality to ignore. The Vurmarians took it as a challenge to overcome on their Gaian world where multiple species were brought in. The Ikirmites got the many deep trenches, the Stevik got the cave systems and humans the land. The [[Parda]] got niche at best regions due to their biology being just too different. The contentiousness of [[Vopson]] made it hard to get even the human friendly clocks onboard, the humans weren't the only species to dislike vopson by 2620 as the Ikirmites had their own troubles with a flock that hunted their kind for sport. The post-Godlen Swarm [[Vopson]] were very despised around the whole of human space as fears of the pathos re-emerging was common, the thralled [[Utanguis]] in the swarm even were too tied to the flocks to break with them. Prospect Spacers in general were proving to be an issue, even more advanced than the humans.

By the 2700's like the Ikirmites, the Stevik had become a widespread presence, even if regional. Their homeworld became enhanced as it integrated to the rest of civilization and in general they proved mostly benign despite the initial fear of outsiders.

Knowing what they think however, has proven remarkably hard
