### Overview

The Ooloopoo are urchin-like creatures with many tendrils from their mouth/anus with prehensile organs on their tendrils.  The Ooloopoo are a primitive species who live amidst a superorganism known as [[Stargi]] or the Folding God by the Ooloopoo.  There is many vibrant species of Ooloopoo spread across their incredibly diverse and extremely biomass rich world of Stargi.  Stargi is actually a Mizar world but of a deviant mentality from the norm, said mentality may be why there are Ooloopoo who are from the ecosystem the Mizar invaded and made their own.  The Ooloopoo have no cultural memory of this, having only attained sapience just 700000 years ago.  Stargi regulates their kinds highly, to say the least and the Ooloopoo never have gotten past a stone age level of sapience thanks to Stargi.
