**Judicator Class AIs**

The late 2600's saw the rise of the Judicator Class AI systems, which were a peacekeeper initiative that had been controversial as using explicitly military AIs had long been seen as questionable.  Even the Vanguard just used such systems to enforce laws, not wage wars basically on their own.   The Judicator systems were command AIs that linked to heavily cyborgized "arms" that got bluntly known as the Deputies.  

Judicator systems still were deeply disturbing to the two rival branches of the [[Grand Assembly]] , with agents from the world ministries and the Plexus sent out to keep tabs on their activities.  It was not without cause, for such activities are believed to be what keeps the Grand Assembly's separation of powers afloat.  It is believed any single branch of power in the [[Trisemblance]] got too much power, the whole system would fall apart.  With much talk and work continued in the internal arms races that layer atop of the external arms races against the [[Virtue Coalition]] and the [[Prospect Space]] aliens.  ((Those who run the Grand Assembly know they don't have a hope in hell of reaching [[The Sprawl]] in advancements and the [[Custodians]] are also pretty far ahead).

Strategic command systems who have a long lineage, prior iterations can be found in use by the Vanguard and machine learning algorithms that were called war AIs had been used in drone warfare as far back as the 21st century.  Judicators go far and beyond mere drone wars, being in effect strategic AIs that make use of networked "Deputies" to take on missions/goals the higher authorities of the Grand Assembly assigns.  Judicator autonomy unsettles some people, indeed world ministries and virtual legalists claim them a subversive force even as they act as one themselves.  That concern usually is addressed by pointing out they are built-in protocols that are compliant in following the Assembly's standards of violence just as anything committed to defense is.  That they are war AIs has not made such suspicions go away, especially with ongoing tensions over their role in secret plans against the Virtue Coalition...
