Stargi is an anomalously “dry” world due to how it heightened the temperature of the planet. By this, it is meant that there was considerable degrees of heating going on.

You cannot expect to understand Stargi with empiricism. This misleads you, for the error of trying to take Stargi apart and analyze its parts leads you to misunderstanding the origin of Stargi.

The first fundamental flaw made is in trying to see Stargi as something which came about through contrivances. You will have been sent down on a death spiral of denying the being of Stargi, as the most materialistic schools of biophysical thought tend to. The being Stargi is very real. It talked to the probes. It acted as one being consistently.

The second fundamental flaw is in trying to see Stargi as a hivemind. You already have failed to understand Stargi with the hivemind outlook. A hivemind is an interconnected network of sapient beings and drones. Stargi’s organization has more in common with a body system and cells with specialized roles. Even more interestingly, there is plenty of organisms that aren’t Stargi who are within and about Stargi regardless.

The third fundamental flaw is the naturalistic fallacy in general, there is a faulty mindset that because Stargi is so integrated as a biosphere, it is some benevolent gaian entity. Stargi is no such being. The geological record shows it took over with incredibly invasive activities, outperforming other ecological systems and spreading its networked ligaments across the entire planet. There does appear to have been quite a lot of conflict in general, for the arms race between parasitic organisms and the biosphere as a whole produced a whole range of organisms including periods of time where multiple instances of Stargi “fought” without better word. One sees a heavily industrialized Stargi at times, only not going further due to needing to regulate itself as a product of being on a high gravity planet. Do not be fooled, Stargi has and will adopt technology given to it by other species.

The age of Stargi is a subject of contention as it is not even clear where Stargi even actually began, leading to radically divided estimates ranging from a mere hundred thousand years to over a hundred million years. It predates the Sprawl and is a true deep time entity in that regard. However, there is a clear ‘cephalization’ dynamic within the record that shows it may have developed many layers of consciousness to further reshape the world to its will across multiple eras, in the process creating a new “Stargi” mind. The most recent iterations of Stargi appear to be more industrial, especially as added pressures of knowing about the galactic civilization which collapsed and than, human civilization led to a unique outlook.

**The Stargi biosphere, in detail**

Stargi is composed of 5 layers of intricate interaction.

-The cloudscapes

The cloudscapes have been molded by Stargi’s will into a vast windscape where the Hadley cells have been precisely organized to create persisting storms across many regions of the world that exist to communicate information and harmoniously arrange migratory megaflora to transport supplies, goods and information to different regions of the world.

-The cyclers

The cyclers act on a smaller scale, they are also a source of Stargite sapients who parasitize on Stargi. These cycler organisms distribute evenly the goods of autotrophic organisms to other parts of the world to a density and scale ligaments or the mycelium do not. They exist also to fuel the megaflora that manage the world, of which is seen as Stargi’s mind. The whole of Stargi can be seen as multiple convergent neural networks which exist to fuel and enact the will of the neural megaflora.  One of the most notorious clades of cycler sapient is the [[Ooloopoo]], who have for lack of better description been compared to sentient sea cucumbers with prehensile organs.

-The Bramble

The twisted bramble, thick from the needs of gravity is what is like the sheathe for the megaflora, it also is where many other non-connected organisms are allowed to exist. The bramble produces and reproduces parts of Stargi, it also acts as a defense mechanism. It is rather alive in practice.

-The mycelium

The mycelium is what is like the world’s nervous system. Many organisms sprout from it and their pain is felt. They are what is used to communicate as a result and are what humans mostly are interacting with when trying to talk to Stargi. How much these mycelium are giving the actual thoughts of the brain trees is not clear at all. But it communicates directly as possible with crude, congregated outgrowths given mouthlike apparati in an attempt to mimic our speech.

-The neural trees

The neural trees are the prime component of the world, they worked symbiotically with the bramble life to spread out around the planet. They look like a savanna at first glance, large trees separated by meadows of mycelium and fortified with bramble. But they are very much interconnected, as one may find out if they try to strike at one. In aggregation they create conscious thought of a large spirit, indeed the largest spirit. They are the essence of Stargi in countless ways and have ways of locally expressing the personality of Stargi that compensate for lag times. Why such communicative spirit exists with them isn’t actually clear. It is what breaks so many theories and evolutionary psychology experts- should Stargi not be some sociopathic, almost animalistic entity that sees outsiders in hostile terms? Yet the mind of Stargi is one which invites and is weirdly warm. Stargi is not a sociopath but something just as bad- a Narcissist.

[Ancient sprawl contact

Stargi appears to have once been a client of some beings from the Sprawl, the nature of the contact isn’t clear. Only that the disconnection from the Rupture appears to have left a very negative view on the Sprawl. Stargi is likely to be holding a wide range of secrets about the Sprawl, but what it has told us often is horrific. How much truth there is to its claims has been limited in knowing, as human have yet to explore the Sprawl enough to verify anything it has said. A theory exists that Stargi has sprawl military technology as deterrence, but it remains a mystery as to why Stargi never has chosen to be expansionistic if that is the case. It is known Stargi has built a grid of mass drivers hidden in the crust as deterrence against human civilization, but again the emphasis is on deterrence more than expansion.

Potential capabilities

-Stargi may be migratory. The orbital pattern of Stargi is anomalous as is the arrangement of planets in the local system. However much no such behavior has been noted in modern times, it can’t be ruled out for prior epochs.

The narcissistic mind of Stargi

So now the truth is here. Stargi is a romanticist and narcissist. Stargi’s sense of love for itself expresses itself in how they are nice at first glance, for they will shower you in admiration to make you like it. Stargi does what it can do to make you adore it so that it may in practice, make you an extension of itself. This behavior and mindset is everywhere with Stargi and has been a toxic phenomena despite the initial positivity it bred. The cults that formed around Stargi are very much a thing Stargi has cultivated as a supposed guru of ancient knowledge it gives those who are worthy of beautiful truths as it calls its knowledge that is just second hand information it got from the sprawl members who gave it data. Even those not engrossed by Stargist thought still may find the romanticism Stargi projects a sense they are non threatening or eccentric. 

Which may well be the case in truth, Stargi has not shown any sign of any ulterior motive than its desire to be adored by others. Why the hell Stargi cares for this is not clear at all, it is believed constantly to be because of how it takes over and remakes the world around it and this mindset is an extension of that. But the current Stargi is also the produce of multiple contact events and old frustrations with ancient societies, not the Stargi which invasively spread themselves across the planet. One notable thing is how Stargi’s biota have been marketed and spread to other worlds, spreading Stargi to other stars. This is why a quarantine on Stargi exists, for the spreading incidents caused serious ecological harm to the worlds Stargi biota were spread. That they also helped terraform less habitable worlds in ways beneficial to human or even stevik life has been seen more as how Stargi tries to manipulate you into spreading Stargi elsewhere. Be careful.
