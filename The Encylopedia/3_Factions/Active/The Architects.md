The architects are the most advanced civilization outside the sprawl, and unlike the sprawl they are very much an active outward player on the galactic stage

Indeed their activities are felt across the whole damn galaxy in ways other forces barely approach- harlapan raiders, composer meddling, silent assassins and so on.

The origin of the architects has been a nebulous one, as while the Aveterriat are generally the founding sapient in the minds of those in the realm the interference of glinnvyr contact is known to have accelerated the Aveterriat expansion. The Aveterriat expansion was a catastrophic event in some regards, as the earlier Aveterriat proved capable of rapid advancement and extreme industrial growth that led to a range of asymmetrical conflicts between glinnvyr and Aveterriat populations as the Aveterriat saw the Glinnvyr as an existential threat over the actions of the Burner and their subterfuge kept that sense ongoing, to the point the paranoia of the Protectorate led them to believing their world states once used to keep the Aveterriat from being killed off so easy by the Glinnvyr had in some way been subverted by the Glinnvyr.
