Or sometimes as they get known, the "Silverites".  They are one of the two most powerful Dozinist leviathans in present day prospect space, with the Mediator Gestalt being the other such leviathan faction.  There is numerous conflicts, ritual and otherwise which continuously are waged by them not only against the [[Urzine Domain]] and [[Metasyndicate]] but also the Mediator Gestalt.  Or the Glowing Swarm, or really any faction they feel like waging a ritual space war against as part of the Silverist Imperatives and how they sort Dozinist Hierarchy in their society.  Gamified warfare was their 'hard power' belief in how [[Dozinism]] revealed itself, much to the contrary "soft" approaches of the [[Mediators]] who once tried for diplomatic supremacy over all else.  

Overview; The Silver Legion is a vast entity that is an ongoing. The above character is Iputurviur Ajeinus, who has with a couple associates who hijacked a zoom call decided to make contact with earth to recruit planet bounded members for its own personal battle thralls but acts like its all about "opportunities". Mainly how if you join their pack you would get access to the stars, travel, healthcare beyond anything our species has and more.

Friends and family? You will make new friends and family and you can always page a friend to join you.

Return? No returning in the near future, but you'll live much longer so there is good chance you will see your planet again.

Salary? 10000 Merits, additional merits for higher rank

"Hey you can't do that" I'm from a far more advanced society than your own with the ability to do interstellar space travel, hijacking a student like this is courtesy compared to what others would have done.

What about women? The silver suits can adapt to any body plan and enhance your strength by orders of magnitude. Once we are done with your upgrades You'll be able to sky dive from orbit and live.

My education? You'll get that downloaded into your mind very quickly. And it has to be a download, there's too much to say right now. You'd break yourself.

Are there other humans? Yes, not many but we have a few other humans.

What about you?

I am Iputurviur Ajeinus, a Slinvus or at times, an [[Utanguis]]. I have fought against intelligent spaceships on orbital installations and in the depths of microgravity ecologies with my own group. But recently I had been requested by the Aputurviur to find more species for the grand cause.

Grand cause? We are a very militarized society, as you may have noticed, but we are not a hateful society. We go around the places of the galaxy we can looking to augment our units with species from many parts of the galaxy. Strength in Diversity has allowed us to become a powerful society and joining us now will mean less friendly societies stay away.

What would be expected of us? Periodical engagements mostly, especially since you would be at the lowest rank but we are a fair society. Even those at the initiate rank have access to resources you don't currently have.

Benefits of the initiate rank? Automated assistants, living units you can personalize using the rationed merits, access to the [[Web of Sensory Overload]], unrestricted access to public hyperspace transit in our volumes and so on already are part of even the lowest ranks. It only gets better from there, we take good care of our initiates no matter the background, well except for the lasuuko but your species would look down on them too if you had to deal with them.

Where are you from exactly? How did you get here? We found a wormhole a hundred light years off, navigated around and stumbled across life signs from this world showing smoke and pollution- the fresh smell of an industrializing society. So they sent me with a single warp frigate. It wasn't easy getting here but we cheat, I just slowed my metabolism to make the year long hundred light year trip from the wormhole feel like a few hours. I don't recommend doing it too much, it can really make your symbionts exhausted.

Symbionts? Oh we are like many from our space, we fill ourselves with symbiotic organisms to cooperate and make ourselves better and more capable. Humans do it too, just in their own way.

Why should we trust you? Because we fought to get here. Do You think the silver legion would send me through a gravity smashing wormhole that took years to stabilize and than go on a warp trip in unexplored space just to mess about? We are not of the Metasyndicate. We are trustworthy, we merely are following the same protocols we have had for centuries and finding an industrial society is a rarity, why would we squander it? If anything it is us who should be more worried about back stabbers! But I am not here to bore you with history, I am here to get you to join our legion.

A legion? that's how our translators interpret the equivalent phrase. We are somewhat an organization but our clients symbiotically cooperate in creating the a leviathan society as grand as the others.

What kind of fighting? You'll be pit against a wide range of opponents, it will be in the silver suit and with an armory your higher ups choose until you prove capable, than you get access to better tech.

So we do the fighting while you sit around? The Silver Legion always fights with their initiates, but not always- only because we want you to also toughen up. Get better, get stronger.

Why would you want humans when robots exist? [[Human]] thinking and actions, body form and so forth along with your own glorious history of conflict show a species able to fight in the legions. We do not do genocide however, so maybe not do the genocide part should you choose to be in the legion.

**The All-Pack**

The Rasufian Legion idealates the “Grand Pack”, the all-pack, the great herd- one that has no borders on species, no borders on anything beyond showing one’s strength and power in demonstrations to Dozin as to the capacity to be enforcer’s of Dozin’s Will.  Extremely liberal theocratic crusader governance is peculiar to human sensibilities but it is consistent with the symbiotic ideals of Dozinism lending itself to being an ideology that has multi-species governance built in.  In practice it is very centered on Utanguis originated cultural norms which flexibly syncretize to other species to make them part of the greater leviathan order at play, as is the usual case with Dozinist regimes. 

What is distinctive is how centered on ritual warfare their pack hierarchy is and how it is a centralized government where there is an “alpha” utanguis, the Musturvier, grand packmater.  The first one, Rasuf, is a revered figure to the point their whole society is known as the Rasufian Legion and those who act in the ideals Rasuf had spread across the stars and brought harmony to the chaos known as Rasufians.  They are in some ways like the Metasyndicate, where they have activity in many parts of Prospect Space that are detachments of their core sectors in the region of prospect space they dominate.  The Rasufians recruit across prospect space for members, they even recruit from primitive worlds their explorers came across at the fringes of Prospect Space. 

Political freedom conceptually is seen differently, the freedom of action is high, the freedom to challenge the core structure however is absent.  Utanguis sense of freedom is in having vectors for power, there must be ways for an Utanguis to strive and have that struggle mean something.  When that is deprived of, unrest is a given.  Mass rioting, protests, violence and such regularly break out from species conflict as well when ‘species conciousness’ and the ‘hierarchy memetic’ are too widespread.  Utanguis supremacy is a de facto governing ideology, but this is not meant to be de jure.  The chauvinism of the Utanguis is felt away more than the Utanguis understand and this has led to species conflicts breaking out.  Some more successful efforts than others, like the Glowing Swarm’s secession from the older Vusidian order or the Sarkic revolt against the Mediators. 

However the most prominent ideologies in Prospect Space prefer multispecies centered pretenses, even the Glowing Swarm would liberalize to wanting swarm governance as a multi-species system instead of the enthrallment/reduction to animalism they used to engage in as the benefits of such species harmony became too clear from how the Rasufians massacred them in a swarm conflict over the Fiyudon sectors 120 years ago with a combined multi-species front.  Rasufian combined arms tactics make use of multiple species to cover the flaws of other species, creating when in order a seemingly unstoppable front against their opponents.  The flaw is in getting that harmony in place, as it requires a discipline and professionalism along with a strong understanding of complex doctrines that adapt to the combinatorics of the many species within the legion to handle the vast range of scenarios encountered within Prospect Space.

The Rasufians view themselves as more pure than the Mediators, who they malign as more on the corrupt side of things due to their “diplomats” being often spies and power grabbers using xenodiplomacy as a lateral means to acquire power for themselves in the vast, convoluted strata of the Mediator hierarchy.
