The biomorphic as a belief system has a deeper intimate truth to it. We are creatures of biology, in the flesh, we must be raw. Strengthening the cultural mold of the biomorphic is a matter of material love.

The ideologies of biomorphic mentality emerged from the depths of the Vusidian dominion during the middle period often skipped over by those who want to pretend like the feuding dramas of the packmaster infighting, the conflicts of Vusidian assimilation, the experiments with void ecologies and the discovery of the sprawl the cobalt had failed to notice due to just charting it as peculiar phenomena. But also important is the growth of the dissident movements. The utanguis never were a species for conformity, even with the aggressive attempt to enforce a widespread theology in [[Dozinism]] and a unified dominion under the will of the biologically immortal avatar of [[Dozin]]. The dissident beliefs festered in dark corners of the dominion, a range of them have been rendered extinct like Musudism and such in the chaos of the cancer, custodian invasion and so on.

The biomorphics however were persistent. They had managed to do away with dozinist dogmas on the perfect form, splitting from the 3 sapient Unity and instead experimenting with countless arrangements. They were persecuted for this, but so often had blended into the societies they were in and when the avatar was assassinated opportunistic packmasters and shepherds vying for power.

It was a dismal time on the whole. So the biomorphic mentality spread, something unique from the radical dozinist sects or the spreading of harmonious thought from the ASI chaos engines known as the Composers.

And now with the context established, the actual nature of the biomorphia can be understood.

The biomorphics do not believe in an abstract higher being or emergent dozinist entity. They do not believe in a system of harmonious emergence. What they believe in is raw expression of the being. This raw expression is totality in countless ways. And it was very appealing tp a wide swathe of utanguis who were sick of the flowery ways of the dozinist, of the pack conformity and of the form restrictions. They sought to instead make forms countless and beautiful not only of other life but themselves, freed of the dozinist obligations of utanguis burden. 

The utanguis is morphologically freed in biomorphic existence. Such mindset was so pervasive reformist dozinist movements adopted it seeing it as a more purel primal expression of dozinist thought. The biomorphics however despised the association, Dozin is nothing but a delusional construction of ancient literature as far as they cared. The biomorphic ones were real and in the flesh. To converge and create greater beings became so obsessive the Invuka Combine, the most prominent biomorphic entity until its destruction became biocollectivistic. The elaborate entities formed by the countless bodies, to show their true force and power to prospect space.

Biomorphic entities despite being widely reviled in dozinist leviathans manage to find some company among the [[Metasyndicate]] and Urzine Domain, despite the mutual contempts. The ikeitans are antidozinists and distrust the biomorphia despite their own hatred’s of dozinism- as the biomorphia hate the actual authorities and physical actors. 

Dozin is just a myth to the biomorphics and don't care at all if Dozin exists or not, it isn't relevant to the biomorphic state of being whether or not Dozin actually exists. The [[Ikeitans]] under the [[Balch Fleet]] and the [[Urzine Domain]] meanwhile, are much truer to their hatred of Dozin or so they claim. And it is the actual ethereal conception of Dozin they see as the threat, without that many reservations for the victims of the parasitic memetic that was afflicted upon existence in the depths of [[Jiwar]] in prior eras.

Meanwhile they slot in nicely as atomized tools of the composers, or would if they didn’t also despise the idea of being at the behest of the composers. The biomorphia seek purest and total raw expression of the form. A total independence and egoism is asserted in all this, one that permits no love for universalist ideological Conceits. Other species must be perfected, just as the utanguis must be perfected. Strengthening the form, making vast web works and mega organisms for the sake of prestige to amplify the biomorphic embrace has been part of what they did. The Biomorphia don’t have any leviathan factions but they control multiple powerful organizations. These include the following:

The Congregation of Zuladusan, a biomorphic entity that is extremely widespread and found across a wide swathe of prospect space that takes a generally neutral position and games every side they can. They are arbitrage manipulators and profited heavily from the [[Akyamas]] scandal, indeed they have been the most diplomatic of the major organizations due to integrating their actions with [[Waywardians]] and Silverites alike. Their help against the composers has been regarded as useful but their inability commit to sides has made them unreliable Allies at best.

The Ventin Yolk, who are situated more around the [[Sarkic]] dominated parts of prospect space and the plastic swarm where they try to transcend barriers through universal DNA known as “the yolk”. They were once strong in the Invuka Combine but with its subterfuge and subversion the Ventin Yolk have been stuck trying to continue the cause. They have been mostly scrupulous due to being manufacturers of nasty toxic substances and enabling terrorism in the mediator gestalt. The Cosmic Cloud has had issues with them as a result.

The Wridlin Fleet, a nomadic traveling trove of biomorphics who know no borders and have many hyperspace signatures they use to travel prospect space at will. They are notorious raiders as a result, seeking to constraint train their forms against the established powers that be in ritual raids and invasions of population centers. Some of those they capture they make part of their fleet.

**Biomorphic nanite technology**

The biomorphics made free use of many kinds of tech including nano tech despite not having the nanofab fab sophistication of the Metasyndicate or Silverites. Such tech has been used to ornament, carve and lubricate their forms for the exhibitionism of their grand forms.

**The Rapid Improvement Goal**

Or RIG, is the main mechanism which is used by biomorphics to compete, gauge symbiont, aligned ethics and further alter to meet a high standard. mind, such goals met often means a change in goal posts in general.
