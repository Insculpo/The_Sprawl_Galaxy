### Overview

The Metasyndicate exists as a product of [[Composer]] meddling, it is a faction built on a cycle of destruction as the Metasyndicate represents the central aspect of [[Fosskemian]] civilization with the rise of the Composers and the quasi-anarchic nature of their society.  

### Beliefs

The Metasyndicate’s primary belief is that of a universal harmony (or the Harmonious Thought) which exists through the flows and rhythms of intelligent life that when tapped into fulfills the entropic vision of what life is supposed to be. The Metasyndicate is ran by no one in theory, in practice the composers pull tons of strings for their purpose is to help keep the universal harmony going. The metasydnciate’s inclinations towards the universal harmony underline the chaotic nature of day to day life in the Metasyndicate for its inhabitants, who often are stuck in an endless game of holding resource providers or ending up in large organizations who hold all the power. The [[Fosskemian]] species in particular are always kept to an avatar stream and aren’t allowed to ever fully die, conscious Fosskemian minds are kept connected to simulacrum fosskemians. This societal norm is due to the Fosskemians themselves wanting to not risk another extinction, indeed the Fosskemians have seeded many worlds with Fosskemian colonies using massive automated colony ships that trek far out into the cosmic void with all records as to their designated stripped while being programmed to randomly change course before picking a world. Such ships exist to act as back up societies should the core civilization ever fall.

The Metasyndicate’s cultural amorality is underpinned by having a hypermaterialist outlook. Such cultural amorality is a product of their lack of regard for age, species or such- all are actors in the great harmony of life as far as the composers are concerned. still they have fears. One is a fear of stability or order, which is associated with death and tyranny and another is dissonance, which is “wrong chaos” and somewhat arbitrarily defined due to the metastability that the Metasyndicate’s elite aspires to. Despite having life extension, life spans in the Metasyndicate are on average 30-50 years which is tiny compared to other civilizations- some do live centuries still, but not regularly. This is more due to the sheer culture of violence in the Metasyndicate far more than due to natural deaths- accidents and breaking minds are also common dangers in the Metasyndicate.

The Metasyndicate utilized a very corporatistic mode of governance in spite of the anarchic pretenses and fosskemian nest complexes have proven to ironically be islands of stability in the storm of endless ritual gang warfare that permeates the Metasyndicate. Trade is a mess and the Metasyndicate has no regard for the territorial demands of other civilizations much to their irritation with populations having basically no gate keeping stopping them from entering or leaving. Such a huge theoretical vulnerability is only addressed by composer organizations having private forces to snuff out such issues. They still remain relatively vulnerable, but most inhabitants of the Metasyndicate are part of armed militia groups of some sort making the Metasyndicate a hellscape to invade as there is nowhere the metasyndicate’s inhabitants avoid building, no matter how outlandish or unlikely.

### Structure

The Metasyndicate is structured to be highly fluid, with territories shifting regularly and lots of smaller scale organizations picking up the slack in a local level that the upper level society does very little for beyond acting as moderators or helping with general agenda directions through the institution of the auditor. The auditor is elected by various high level leaders given the honor of electing the auditor and the Auditor acts as a dictator in control of the system fleets who do whatever the auditor wants, the system fleets often in practice will kill auditors who cross them. The composers have some control over the system fleets and organizers, but not much as the composers work through manipulating the situation to avoid power monopolies which is why the composers have their own private space fleets despite electing the auditor.

The Metasyndicate on regional levels is very free, with machine laborers and contract slavery widespread along with all matter of arcology bosses often convincing to create some semblance of order where there is none. Consumer Unions run rampant on some worlds due to a lack of ability to regulate, causing all matter of unimaginable damage to whatever place they occupy with accidents being common due to mind uploading and avatars being so common that no regard is given to the well being of anyone. These consumer organizations often end up in huge shooting fights with other groups just to have basic rights and they get regular mockery in the media system.
The virtual media system is what holds the Metasyndicate together more than anything else, acting as a culturally unifying force where political unity cannot exist. It is very often that groups in a war may cease fire just to finish some timed sonata before resuming a conflict. The media forces are a mess themselves, but insure a common language across the Metasyndicate and also ensure some common currency across the Metasyndicate as well. The other unifier, the Composers is also often brought up.

### Demographics

The Metasyndicate isn’t known for high birth rates, but they have a considerable population of 875 trillion individuals. The majority of which make use of avatars in some shape or form. The Metasyndicate’s population counts betray just how dense some parts of their space get living wise, as there’s no upper level planning down on infrastructure beyond a general “build shit” initiative or whatever private projects the larger organizations have in mind for a place.

The Metasyndicate has around a couple million composers total, but these composers each are known for being much more powerful than average spaceships and make use of tech mostly unseen elsewhere in the Metasyndicate, it’s not entirely clear where they found the tech.
The Metasyndicate military is huge for the size of the population, they have over a two hundred billion militarily armed spaceships across their space of mostly low quality. Such population disparities are countered only by the extremely advanced distortion skills of the composers and their tendency to influence things by proxy. It is also extremely divided a military, with many factions and constant internal conflict.

Their populations go as follows-

2 million composers
54% [[Fosskemian]]
7% [[Vopson]]
2% [[Utanguis]]
12% [[Whandl]]
7% [[Veemer]]
2% [[Zakkai]]
1% [[Human]]
9% [[Jama]] systems
6% synthetic sapients (see [[Prospect Space Biosynthetics]])
1% Other sapients ( [[Zakkai]] for instance)

Around 60% of the population has access to a backup life from some living insurance business. Not always reliable.

### Tech

The Metasyndicate has many feared weapons and munitions, with electromagnetic weapons mass produced and resonance wave projectors being basically a small arm for them. The Metasyndicate is also extremely avid in their use of anti-particles and anti-matter energy. They still make use of batteries at times, but this is due to how their ability to subvert electronic systems is unparalleled as is their ability to intercept communications, something that centuries of organizational feuding has made their bread and butter.

There is also a fair amount of biotech that is used in the Metasyndicate, but not to the degrees of biomorphic civilizations. It is common to seek augmentation in the Metasyndicate as well, along with all matter of niche items and historical artifacts.
