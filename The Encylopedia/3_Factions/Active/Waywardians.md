# Waywardians

## Overview

The Waywardians are a [[Fosskemian]] founded society which formed not long after the [[Custodians]] invaded.  They were once highly allied to the Composers, but as time went on they progressively became more and more hostile to the Composers due to viewing them as a perversion of Fosskemian identity.  This left the Waywardians with little friendliness towards the [[Composer]] who tried to manipulate them.  It is from that, the Waywardians went about using suits everywhere along with all matter of obscuring and obfuscation to hide the vibrant society they have.  

## Beliefs

The highly cosmopolitan Waywardians originated in conflict with the Composers and believe strongly in self determination, they have god war ward in their own minds by having successfully gone rogue on Composers to achieve the impossible society- a Fosskemian founded society that has consistency to it.  This internal consistency follows moral and ethical codes very foreign to even the rest of the prospect, their intentional isolation from others being intense as is.  Their diversity is from more the groups who joined them earlier on- before they self isolated and the multiple species part of the Waywardians co-developed in isolation of the other species in the prospect.  

## Demographics

The Waywardians are believed to have 785 trillion non-Synthetic inhabitants across a relatively small span of stars.  Structurally they're built to be hard to read, so this data is already unreliable.  All we know is from their own claims, so we go with this as it seems consistent from our own observations.  But the Waywardian contempt for any determination and certainty has made this harder than usual.
