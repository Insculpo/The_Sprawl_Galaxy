<h2>The Mediators</h2>

### Overview

The Mediators are a civilization built on duplicity.  The Mediator Gestalt is the product of the Gestalt and Mediators, two former apparati of the Dominion, merging after centuries of division.  Attempts to consolidate the Silver Legion would be far less successful.  

The Mediators are in open perpetual conflict with their multiple rivals- The Urzine, the Silent Pact and the [[Metasyndicate]] That has been on an ongoing proxy conflict for the [vus](Cultural_Beliefs/Vus_Valuation.md) of greater ecumenical region of living civilization. The Mediators as one of the most powerful empires of the quadrant we exist in also have influence over the politics of many societies across the known galaxy.

The centrality of the Mediators in our part of the galaxy cannot be underestimated. While other regions of the galaxy are dominated by other civilizations, the Mediators are the most relevant to the concerns of the Civic and much of Prospect Space.  Their clout is everywhere.

### Beliefs

The Mediators come from a lineage of multiple other civilizations that had risen and fallen before it derived from the mythical cobalt. Having been founded after bioweapons such as the cancer were unleashed and the ikeitan bioships arose, the Mediators remain a society burdened with the baggage of millennia old struggles and infrastructure.  Such as the interstellar highways of older times being retrofitted for their needs or the remnants of older megastructures being repaired and recolonized.

The Mediators themselves outlook wise hold to somewhat of a secular outlook built around biological integration.  The belief of civilization as a living organism is widespread and enforced by the very tech they use being mutagenic, living and of a style steeped in their mastery of biological processes. The Mediators don’t have nearly the sort of separation of bodies we tend to think about, where every body is a closed system beyond the bacteria that pass through us.

Instead even consciousness itself is a fluid passed around numerous nodes.  This leads the Mediators to have a civilization of identities and personalities spread across multiple organisms, sometimes from entirely different worlds. This mainly applies to the highest classes of Mediator society, but it remains an outlook that trickles down.

The Mediator consciousness stream relies of multiple bodies much as it is always viewed to have from the Utanguis.  Some of these gestalt consciousnesses are world spanning, if not even interstellar in scope due to hyperspace tower infrastructure. Still, the Mediator usage of synthetic technologies and an understanding of biology seemingly unparalleled has led to biotechnology being a massive basis of their civilization.  This is to the point where they make use of all matter of synthetic gel systems which construct into whatever constructed forms they need them to.  That is, when they aren’t making countless bioengineered diseases or entities seemingly having learned nothing from the cancer.

The old traditional beliefs in the Dozinian hierarchy are still widely practiced as are more traditional Utanguis celebrations and symbiosis rituals.   Indeed such symbiosis rituals had been abstracted and utilized to integrate their many uplifts, assimilate alien species and perpetuate the idea of species meritorcracy.  Where the pyramid of [[Dozin]] can be climbed.

### Structure

The Mediators follow a hierarchal system with various semi-independent branches of power that when combined with the hyperspace towers allow them to consolidate over an impressive span of space.  All the while also having a massive hegemony to the envy of countless civilizations. The Mediator Hierarchy relies on a higher council that acts as the representational elite of the Mediators, where a council of representatives makes all the important decisions. The system is somewhat of a timocracy, where voting such representatives is viewed as a privilege for those who are most qualified to make such choices... ironically this had failed to stop some particularly poor councils from forming at critical points in time due to the nepotism rampant in Mediator culture.  Since qualified can mean simply being a good friend of someone as opposed to someone who knows well about their very situation.

The highest power within their system are the Mediator diplomats themselves in practice, with their association holding much of the power despite the existence of the council who basically exist to work out the more civilian matters.  Of whom are lacking any jurisdiction over the military forces who act entirely independently. The council has its own private military force from the Mediators, but it isn’t able to consolidate their fleets due to the lack of staying power council members have.

The gestalt as a whole is viewed as the supreme consciousness of the mediators, with many of the diplomats encountered being vessels of this greater consciousness for part of the time- it’s seen as a pleasure and privilege to do so.  For it is feeling Dozin's embrace, a glimpse into the transcendent future which the Mediator Gestalt aspires to bring forth to the galaxy.

### Demographics

20% [[Utanguis]]
8% [[Fosskemian]]
18% [[Vopson]]
10% [[Sarkic]]
14% [[Whandl]]
3% [[Vilate]]
23.5% Synthetic Entities
1.5% Other sapients 

The total population of the Mediator Gestalt is hard to know due to the shifting allegiances of the inhabitants, with a flux of 10% of the population on a regular basis in the ecumenical frontier regions. this lends to a population around 6.5-7 quadrillion separate individual minds who are part of Mediator space. This betrays the true biomass of their civilization, with is far greater than the population suggests.

### Tech

The Mediators make use of a vast range of biotech and growable technologies within a paradigm of biomineral processing that makes up the basing for their civilization’s tech.  Advancements have gotten as far as a primitive form of star lifting and dyson swarms developing in multiple parts of their society.

The vast scope of the Mediators is borderline incomprehensible for most human beings to even begin to understand.  They have memetic kill devices being common along with their mastery of biology allowing them to carry out all matter of fanciful activities with regard to synthetic biology.  Primarily in experiments to create a universal genome, an experiment they adopted from the Sprawl and hope to one day permeate across Prospect Space.

Organic life to the Mediators is something to be molded at will. There is somewhat of a sterility to Mediator civilization all tech as well that separates it from the Urzine who are similarly advanced but their embrace of Darwinian thinking makes them radically different in their usage of the same tech.

Spaceship technology is advanced enough that the [[Personal Combat Boneship]] is widely used along with all matter of vessels with a wide range of applications using similar smart materials able to repair most damage with some regenerative biogel.

**The Modern Dozinist**

Utanguis pack hierarchy in the modern form is not solely built around the ongoing ideal of dozinist thought contrary to what those who are elementary in their comprehension of xenocivics whose dough-like brainfolds reduce every species to “individual” and “collective”.  Dispense of that delusion.  It will not help you in understanding alien life anymore than it would understanding your own species.  The utanguis sense of self is tied into their symbiotic unions, but this is not in the mindset of hive collectivism.  The failure mode is thinking dozinism is a hive mindset, it is not.  The mainstream fold of the utanguis would regard that as cancer.   They called xenoforming WMDs that do such assimilation cancer.  They have power hierarchies in the human sense, except with a staged approach to power with ritualized mechanisms for gaining/losing power that the packs mutually have agreed upon with theology being one of the vectors for standardizing those rules.  Utanguis do not universally follow these rules, but most do as the schism violence which happens when the guidelines and rules are violated is often mutually destructive and the violator will find itself with free reign to the worst, most horrifying actions the Utanguis biotechnology are actually capable of.  Punitive disintegrations is a threat that hangs over Utanguis who do not play by the rules, which do get revised.  The rules in practice do show some favor for the established power structure, they exist for maintaining a hierarchy at the end of the day. 

However, there is a lot more clear social mobility than in even human systems.  Struggles for pack dominance are a common, expected fact of life and the high populations of Utanguis in the post-uplift eras meant more elaborate mechanisms of social mobility.  There is mixed loyalties- loyalty to the pack, loyalty to dozin, loyalty to the leviathan.  An utanguis varies in where they see themselves closest.  So much of societal tension is trying to figure these loyalties out, which leads to an environment of mixed trusts and social complexities.  Assassination cascades have happened countless times with cycles of violence a human could only comprehend as biblical.  The hierarchy is regularly shaken up in what can only be regarded as cycles of ritualistic conflict.  Why these mechanisms persisted to advanced technological civilization is unclear.  [[Human]] hierarchies are much colder in these kinds of power struggles, with large organized factions operating against each other and mass movement mentality.  The Utanguis meanwhile seemingly are more oriented on open conflict and rivalry, reveling in it even.  The oligarchy seems to benefit from this, a fire underneath their leaders that makes nepotistic incompetents as much as it rips them to shreds. 

The oligarchy has its pack meetings with representatives who have no real power compared to the apaturviers of their packs.  Often the representatives are servants, so do not think them representatives of the public at all.  They aren’t.  There isn’t elections- which exist in some form in Prospect Space with the Metasyndicate and [[Urzine Domain]] but are absent in the Gestalt where such elections are seen as a dull mechanism for determining the hierarchy.  The hierarchic fixation is not universal, the lower echelons of the Mediator Gestalt this oligarchy is able to exist because of is a mixture of Utanguis and non-Utanguis, Mediators have non-utanguis who are in their elite but they must play by their rules of power.  A [[Whandl]] may game their system to be a prominent ranking member of the Utanguis society, but they have to play by rules made by symbionts from a high gravity world.  The Whandl are crablike organisms from a low gravity world who have more social societies than the Utanguis.  They don’t even use the same liquids.  One may see how the Whandl would run into many barriers in the mythos of Mediator impariality.  

That the Mediators themselves hail themselves as a successor civilization to the [[Vusidian Dominion]], an openly theocratic caste hierarchy ran by an immortal autocrat makes the illusion the Mediators have crafted all the more impressive.  The Mediators did in their defense, derive their corpus from the reformist movement who lionize the martyred Utanguis Siduf and really did make a more fluid system that better handles the advantages/disadvantages of the species within their hierarchy.  But still, it is a hierarchy all the same that has innovated massively not in their ability to mask hierarchy but also in their ability to exploit the species they have brought to the fold.  The chauvinism and arrogance seen in the Mediator leadership, the resentments of the Utanguis who failed the mechanisms and the sapients who end up in de facto castes despite being gaslight since their birth about the fairness and all-love of [[Dozin]] only to face the hostile reality of a crushing hierarchy that seems to only have them exist instead of be replaced by biomechanical entities just due to being cells for a being on a scale so distant most have to be bludgeoned with heavily wrought dozinist propaganda.
