The Purifiers were initially a tool to deal with runaway void ecologies made by the mediators gestalt over six centuries ago.  However, the purpose of the Purifiers changed as the needs of the mediators changed and they became increasingly an organization dedicated to assassination and subversion of undesired groups.  They were after the Appathi Revolution, however, made more open in their used as basically enforcers of the wheel and as a mechanism to purge "Dominionistic forms of [[Dozinism]]".  The Purifiers still are used as exterminators of some kinds of parasitic/hostile void ecology but overall their purpose shows to be mixed from just dealing with unwanted intrusions.
