Formed by [[Iputurvier Aklan Hraka]] to handle interspecies relations with fellow aquatic thralls (really just the rekimites) and has a couple loose fosskemian associates in their work in pooling together merits to buy weapons and WMDs to destroy the leviathans on their ocean worlds.  The Rezin just want to find ways to appease their "masters" as they still worship leviathan creatures they built their societies in and around as gods even as they are in fucking spaceships.  The Alephids want to remove sea monsters from their homeworld using the advanced tech the Rasufians have, even at the expense of the ecological preservation which gets ideated by more ecologicist groups.  Of which also exist in [[Prospect Space]] due to biotech loving vast libraries of genetics and original copies of homeworlds having some level of use. The conflicts of interest appear when other cultural groups from their homeworld get representatives in the Hraka Clique.

**Iknap Hraka**

Iknap is a Rekimite who fed their elders to the megaplankton just as their elders did.  Iknap knows it too one day will be fed to the megaplankton just as the way the cosmos works.  Iknap joined the legions mainly for posterity, but came to have a respect for Aklan seeing a shared sense of duty and sacrifice.  Of course Aklan's sense of sacrifice was to change the world while Iknap's sense of sacrifice was to keep the fire and harmony going.  Iknap still was part of the guild and pretty high ranked due to their personal ties with Aklan.  Iknap knew Aklan wanted to bring weapons to their home world and saw helping that cause as a way of showing respect for those willing to die for something greater, but Iknap would have a falling out as it came to get what exactly Aklan's goal was.  That was, to wipe out every Samala on [[Maraterna]] and blow itself up with a fusion bomb as it so prophesized itself doing in its drug addled visions.  Iknap was horrified by this because it feared the possibility of the interlopers on [[Rekim]] taking inspiration and doing the same to the megaplankton from their homeworld.
