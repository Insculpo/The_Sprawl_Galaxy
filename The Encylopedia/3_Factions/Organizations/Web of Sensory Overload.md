The WSO is one of the most powerful media conglomerates in [[Prospect Space]], with many branches, syndications and channels of mind streams in their grand media corpus.  They had been fragmented by the [[Akyamas]] Scandal, indeed they were a major target of it and the post-scandal WSO has way more composer clout.  Indeed they have shifted their mediascape to one dominated by [[Composer]] propaganda, but they still host Silverite recruitment adverts even after the [[Giparna]] crisis as the vast dross of virtual realms and transmedia forces can be heard, smelt, seen, touched, quasimerged, buzzed, zapped and breathed by the many inhabitants of prosoect space.
