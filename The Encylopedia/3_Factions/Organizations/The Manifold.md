The Manifold is a complicated faction (and overall affinity) which is mostly ikirmite ran.

**Nipluku Rasikula**

Nipluku Rasikula was an [[Ikirmite]] from the Rasikulan Sphere who is known as the founder of the Manifold, whose affinity binding the Manifold as an entity.  The Manifold came about from Nipluku's frustration and resentment against the dominance humans had shown to have, a hard to break dominance which they knew could only be done through a tapestry of alignment and encrypted autonomy.  The memories of the Void Divers and the questionable conditions the [[Grand Assembly]]'s integration of [[Ikirma]] to the Assembly had meant there was always a silent resentment to the overall situation even after the Plexus neutrality pact.  Nipluku's Manifold (not the Ikirmite Manifold, at times it is only known as The Manifold due to there being many Ikirmites uninterested in manifold goals or otherwise simply seeing the species exclusivism as too deeply xenophobic (Nipluku also worried of the Ikirmites being too "backwards" seeming relative to humans and not wanting the Manifold to come off as merely being one alien overlord replacing another alien overlord).

Nipluku's works had extended the reach of the Manifold to all matter of groups within the Plexus, always there but never openly so in the way the GA or VC were.  And this unintentionally made the tech and methods of the Manifold useful, with tech cooperation proposals from the Pact and the Plexus being done in secret for security purposes.  Ikirmite encryption was needed to deal with the infiltration issues in theory.  And the Manifold Ikirmites were all too quick to see the leverage potential involved.  And the mutual interest of Prospect Spacer interlopers being dealt with gave too much probable cause.

**Manifold vs the Unaffiliated**

Manifold Ikirmites represent the dominant affinity among the Ikirmites, they have organized a vast knowledge network and mafia activities across a lot of planets.  Their distrust of others is strong as usual, but they play along enough the Manifold is seen as an ally society of the Plexus and in practice not really being regarded by the Plexus as any worse than the agendas of the VC or GA.  Just with the idea of affinity hegemony instead of cyborg federation or the BCI hive consensus.  Regardless, the manifold is 20% of the Ikirmite population at most in reality.  Most ikirmites are 'unaffiliated', usually due to being arranged into contrasts and saturations instead or otherwise in smaller affinities with their own agendas instead of the ambitions of the Manifold to be a Plexus super power.
