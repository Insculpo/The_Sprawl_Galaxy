The Jatarsian Rainbow is a large appliance conglomerate that cross produced multiple kinds of gadgetry.  They would be regarded by humans as a mega corporation but they would insist they are actually a liquid gestalt, which more or less is a gestalt one may affiliate with other gestalt as well as loyalty is not valued, just work of making/selling goods to them and purchase of their goods.  Indeed how much they actually produce is notoriously fluid, as they bulk buy from other groups and sell to whoever buys in sectors lacking good access to that tech.  The liquid gestalt itself seems to just like the managerial aspects of moving such goods around, making use of runner crafts ran by their own [[Jama]] collectives that efficiently hand gadgets out amorally.  The Gliysmar based central zone has been under composer scrutiny on if they are a stagnating force, so to get around that the Jatarsian Rainbow usually does foster internal competition though that is not enough for the composers who went about propping up their rivals with endorsements along with manufacturing scandals by leaking trade secrets for their "overreach".  Despite that they remain a significant force in a large share of prospect space and a common brand name when it comes to getting whatever bizarre gadget their general stores sell. 

Such "gadget" include basically personal archivers, various forms of slaved data miners to stalk people with, multilateral presence generation, emergency nutrition soup for your symbionts, vector jackers, point defense fields, vacuum defense systems, various living toys, various living assistants (which include what we'd call bots, prospect spaces don't separate natural and artificial automata).
