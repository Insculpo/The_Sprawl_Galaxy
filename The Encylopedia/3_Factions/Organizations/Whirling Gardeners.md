Another mercenary organization that acts in defense of void ecologies and does the job of manipulating ecological dynamics through aggressive interventionism.  Removing a species, introducing invasive species, manufacturing a bloom, augmented some biotech, they deal in a lot of these trades and also have been open to doing ecoterrorism for those who want it.  [[Mediators]] prop them up for their own privateering a lot, so they have ardent appathism going on.  They are also said to maybe at times work with even the bilethought, but the zealotry of Anapathism makes such developments circumstantial at worst.
