Quasi-Rogue Silverites not loyal to the Silver legion who managed to get a shifter drive of their own with a large dwarf planet sized world ship they base their nomadic operations from.  They see themselves as the freest expression of the silver legion, viewing the other packs as too sedentary and so they broke with that sedentary way in favor of a traveling band of advanced mercs who actually have a shocking amount of ties with silverites, mediators and even the bilethought.  They are less friendly to some groups though still have integrated many species to the free legion’s system of battle thralls.  The Free Legion has mercenary contracting divisions and even privateer divisions, contrary to the more noble image their propaganda would tell you.  They just hold themselves to high standards, ranks and merit.  They happen to like merit as the system of currency.
