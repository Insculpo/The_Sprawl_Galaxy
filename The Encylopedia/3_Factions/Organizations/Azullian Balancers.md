The Azullian (*utanguis or [[Fosskemian]] word for blue*) Balance Makers (Or simply, the Balance Makers)

The Azullian Balancers are one of the more feared mercenary outlets out there, being used for a wide range of services from privateering to protecting whoever can afford their services.  The Balancers make use of a range of resonance weaponry while using tubular mesh works, of which some have drawn parallels to the waywardians with but they are far more to the cause of harmony and have their own vested interest in causing troubles as that keeps the environment favorable for their work.  They often help factions in conflicts that are losing more, seeing them as needing the balance and help along with being more open as clientele for their arms industry.  They are widespread a force, with activity mainly around the [[Metasyndicate]] and [[Urzine Domain]], with a lot of former [[Rasufian Legion]] militants who were abandoned to the void.
