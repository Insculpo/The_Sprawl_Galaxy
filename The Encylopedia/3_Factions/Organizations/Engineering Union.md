The Engineering Union of the [[Grand Assembly]] and its constituent world ministries has activity all across the Grand Assembly sectors.  The operation they do is one which promotes not only quality spaceships for the Grand Assembly and ensuring that civilian space travel is safe as riding on a nuclear powered missile can be.  

The engineers of the Engineering Union are not cheap and often expect accommodations beyond the norm, of which is usually compensated for with the refinement and quality of the vessels their nanoforged composites enable.  They keep within union circles all matter of trades taken from esoteric sources (often prospect spacers without loyalty to their own society) and fund collective bargaining for a wide range of sectors to keep their own clout.  The scale of the engineering union is confusing due to the decentralized structure the engineering goes by with many chapters in many parts of the Grand Assembly.  They are unable to operate outside the Grand Assembly due to the assembly bulk being the main transaction their economics go by.

The Engineering Union often represents itself with an abstracted truss mixed with a mainframe, symbolizing the solid support they give those who are part of the union.  The Engineering Union is so extensive it also runs numerous specialized education institutions to increase the talent pool due to how there is always more demand for spaceship engineering especially with the arms race build ups that the galaxy has provoked. 

The Engineering Union is behind most of the spaceship standardization in the Grand Assembly as local governments often will commission spaceships from them , be it purpose built for the local situation or the more generalize spaceships seen elsewhere.
