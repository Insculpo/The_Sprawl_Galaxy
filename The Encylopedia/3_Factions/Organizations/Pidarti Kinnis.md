The Pidarti [[Kinnis]] are cult-like Sprawl hunters and traders of sprawl artifacts who cooperate with multiple factions.  They work with multiple societies but ultimately are self interested.  They have composer influence all about, but the ikeitans also have influence as do mediators and the cosmic cloud.  It's a bit a cluster fuck of authorities those who work for them sorta just learned to go with the flow of, so there's no loyalty to any of those factions.  They store a lot of artifacts on the world of [[Apatujur]], which is has all matter of exotic properties to it.  They also happen to have a media network documenting and open airing public arguments on the nature of various artifacts as a weird historical society that happens to also have a private security force.  Historians that end up at times, doing history.
