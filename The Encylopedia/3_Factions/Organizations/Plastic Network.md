The Plastic Network is a large conglomerate where acid minds and Plastic Swarmers mixed with multiple ranges of acidic flux and flow and [[Whandl]] mediascapes distributed through them.  Indeed the acidity of their content can kill humans without the proper protection, literally so at times.  They compete constantly with the WSO by showing more snuff content and promoting a wide range of hyperspecialized content on subject matters that are basically swarm propaganda to grow a swarm by indoctrinating others into their fixation points.  This sub competition is mediated by plastic swarmers who get lots of disgust and suspicion from the glowing and pale swarmers who tolerate them just for their seeming impartiality.
