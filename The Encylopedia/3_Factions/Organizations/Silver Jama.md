The Silver [[Jama]] are a Jama group who find work to do and do that work, ever frustrated with the inefficiencies they see elsewhere.  They are obsessed with their mining rights and territories regardless and constantly hate how they are regularly dragged into needless complications.  They have a lot of cooperation with local political machines meant to basically secure those mining rights and force clients into buying asteroid material from them and them alone, this has caused lots of tensions needless to say.  And people who literally will go interstellar distances just to not deal with the mad miners.
