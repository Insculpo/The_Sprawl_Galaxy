A cleaner setup

-1.27 mya: The enigmatic wave. The event was captured as a formality. No one knows the full implications behind it. The Crusis Wave and its origins are unknown. What is left of it, the crux, is but rocks of an incomprehensible substrate only cargo cult copies have been made of.

[The unknown]

-Tarpoids overthrown by the Dioviermes at some point 50 millennia ago.

-The sprawl formed from the post-overthrow pantheonic leagues and their galactic ambitions

-The Archivists split from the ecumenical project in disgust to instead make pure truth. -Pure truth is at odds with the narrative oriented outlook of the ecumenical. To the point it ended apocalyptically.

-Tarpi are reduced to fringe populations, never recovered. No interest to.

-Ecumenical spread across the galaxy, assimilating upstart civilizations to the galactic community and being seen as a powerful, enlightened civilization that built cities that spanned planets, entire manifolds and more.

-Factionalism in the ecumenical saw the bunker world phenomena and suicidal star minds

-It also was why the nebula-like Tarpoids were an ongoing trouble.

-Along with knocking down the Virgo in the galactic core in an operation that was shockingly effective, at least for a time

-However the Archivers and cracking them proved a dangerous venture

-The Archiver-Ecumenical war caused the rupture. The Archivers had knowledge but not all of it. They didn't realize fully the failsafes. -The ecumenical collapsed harder than the Archivers ever wanted.

-And the annihilators that emerged destroyed many Archiver worlds before they had also been defeated in the last war. Notable for happening 8 millennia ago.

-Harlapans were first space faring 17 millennia ago, but the Ecumenical (which had been integrating them) and the rupture knocked their kind back to primitive forms across the galaxy by the 10 millennia mark.

-It would be another thousand years before anywhere in the galaxy had a space daring civ develop without the guidance of the ecumenical.

-Of which collapsed into what we known as the Sprawl. A decrepit mess of fossil wormhole networks, lost hyperspaces, rogue automatas and warlord denizens with black box tech. That is the most advanced civilization in the galaxy.

-7 kya: Glinnvyr develop space travel from the Clipsan Jovian system

-Burner Incident around 6 Kya

-Prismatic coalitions appear around what used to be nomadic glinnvyr volumes ~5.5 kya

-Phidians became space faring 5kya

-The Sprawl attempted to reunify around 4.7 kya, it failed causing the abandoned nexus and further disconnections

-The ripple effect altered the trajectory of Glinnvyr society to solipsistic leagues

-Vitani Plague in 4.2 kya, Zikelli also would arise as a client from the uplifts

-Harlapans emerge with a new interstellar civilization about 4 kya, reassembled from fallen pasts and facing against Glinnvyr entities

-Ovatar was one of the highest solipsistic Glinnvyr societies, formed around 3.8 kya

-Avatraeriat had space faring about 3.4 kya but stayed at their homework for centuries until the "Giver" arrived 2.9 kya

-The Prospector Probes make landfall at Blolados around 2.7 kya, uplifting experiment

-The expansion of 2.6 kya by Aveterriat

-The Architects are established as a powerful force around 2.3 kya

-Ovatar's fall in 2.1 kya

-Sprawl policy shift occurred at this time to a higher level of interest in the interstellar upstarts. Not by much.

-The Shattering occurred 1.8 kya

-Vusidian Dominion expands from the shattering, spreading void ecologies with it around 1.7 kya

-Protectorate invasion of the colonies in 1.6 kya ends in stalemate and the Vmiskii revolution

-Ascension War occurred 7 cya
