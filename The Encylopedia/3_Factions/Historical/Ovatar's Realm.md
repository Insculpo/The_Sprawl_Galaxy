Ovatar is the master Mind of the Jewel Box cluster, presiding over the most fine cut gems from across the galaxy with over septillion gems on display at all times across hundreds of star systems, with carbon worlds minted into rubies or emeralds and impurities sniffed out over thousands of years of rigidity study.  Ovatar is an architect affiliate, originating from an [[Aveterriat]] AI which grew and grew until it segmented itself within a tangerine shell and expanded from there, deviating from the ancient tradition of centralized leadership and being the shepherd of creation in the promised cluster of the Jewel Box.  Ovatar isn't a friend of outsiders beyond as observers of the world gems and the its personal creation, the Zarathustra who dominate the region.  The Zarathustra became sapient within centuries and would go on to become stewards of many worlds, demanding blood sacrifice from natives in the name of loyalty and often believing their own propaganda that they are gods.  Ovatar finds its children horrifying, but it doesn't do much about it, being far too occupied with securing its treasure trove of world gems and Dyson swarms filled with crystal-gel state entities.  The preserve attitude of Ovatar is well known, as its belief that the minerals it has horde have absolute value, much more than organic life.  It treats its gems far better than the Aveterriat it roped up into its cult.
