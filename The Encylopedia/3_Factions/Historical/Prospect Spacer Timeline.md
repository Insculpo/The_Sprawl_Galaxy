-Year 210 BP: The Plutocratic Fosskemians

-Year 135 BP: The Vopallian Exodus

-Year 0: The Uplifting of the Utanguis / Prospector Contact

-Year 120: Cobalt is consolidated, the ancient utopia

-Year 750: Cobalt went mad around this point, the caretaker AIs became paranoid of each other

-Year 900: The Great Shattering

-Year 1040: Dominion rises as a prominent force

-Year 1400: The Dominion is the dominant celestial empire, in just 5 centuries turning the Utanguis from a species of pets in the ruins of their once masters to the overlords of a vast empire. Minor factions persisted, but the bulk of conflict became infighting and attempted sprawl raids. They also did contact other civs but they were always too distant, so deterring and info gathering on their capabilities was the norm.

-Year 1550: The Wheelist Revolts

-Year 1700: The Living Archives are created

-Year 1875: The great lasuuko slaughter

-Year 2040: The Pilot's Revolt

-Year 2045: Vanguard is formed

-Year 2052: The Ikeitan Wars

-Year 2061: Present day on Earth

-Year 2070: Ikeitan Exodus

-Year 2105: The Mind of Dozin is fusion bombed by the Dozin Killer

-Year 2106: The cancer is unleashed

-Year 2120: The Epoch of Violence Begins as warring waves of entities emerge, neodominion remains powerful regardless

-Year 2177: Composers are born from the Vopallian Rebirth as Sul Vopal’s archives radically alter the ethics of the Drifters and Neutrals, the post-caretaker beings that let the Utanguis do whatever since they had been disillusioned by prior generation wars.

-Year 2200: Another generation war that is more the Composers indoctrinating other prospector entities to their revelations than anything else

-Year 2245: The Custodian/Architect Invasion began

-Year 2247: Golden Swarm exodus

-Year 2345: The Architects withdraw, having failed to achieve much beyond making the situation worse as Composers became ascendant and they left a power vacuum

-Year 2370: Ikeitan Invasion

-Year 2400: Various Fosskemian societies come and go

-Year 2415: Vanguard Collapse

-Year 2465: Urzine Domain is pushed back by a coalition of new-Dozinist groups

-Year 2550: A lot of tensions continue, Ividun Collective appears

-Year 2585: The Ramos Foundation is wiped out by unknown forces

-Year 2600: Waywardians appear

-Year 2640: Schism between Dozinist societies, alliance between ikeitans and Fosskemians form a situation

-Year 2655: Bilethought terror wars

-Year 2670: The Metasyndicate forms from competing groups, composer direct rule is normalized even with the auditor as a basically ceremonial position

-Year 2707: the Ividun Collective is wiped out by the Metasyndicate with temporary alliance building with Dozinists and Ikeitans (a miracle), which was a rising society that was viewed as an existential threat to prospect space much like the Bilethought

-Year 2712: Silent Pact ships appear.

-Year 2730: The Akyamas Scandal, large shares of prospect space are destabilized by the Metasyndicate. Ikeitans become hostile to the metas for different reasons

-Year 2737: Human and Tikali immigration through the jump gates begin

-Year 2750: The Distrubed War breaks out from mass panics across much of prospect space of reasons unclear,

-Year 2775: The Balch test their WMD systems

-Year 2799: The Gretira Massacre causes a civil war to break out in the Mediators, a society already having been a powder keg from ongoing riots and mass civil unrest over the injustices of "species meritocracy". Prior attempts at reform in the past century went south and the Gretira Massacre was generally viewed as the first shots in what was a civil war / revolution that had been coming for a long time (mainly as the scars of the ikeitan wars and factional tensions that sprung from it ripped open)

-Year 2800: Present day?

Apex Predator; The Era of the Primordial Leviathan Society of the Dominion.

The grand leviathan, the dominion that regimented to the hierarchy of Dozin, the Utanguis ran civilization that in their authoritarian thinking also was a dominion that grew life as a source of pride. Integrating upstarts into their greater corpus, the leviathan body bringing into itself a vast range of beings both from alien worlds and what had developed in the vast void ecologies they had cultivated
