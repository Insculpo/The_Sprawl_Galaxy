The long TL

This is the simple summary of 4-5 years of lore concepts, more even if you count the pre-2017 sprawl lore. One of the sprawlverse qualities that is unique has to be simply the continuity. It is a galaxy of cause and effect, tethered to an implied system far more vast than what is perceptible in the scope of an already overscoped to hell and back galaxy.

[Crusis wave (81000 BP-63200 BP)

Enigmatic first signal from a lost civilization. It is not clear the significance of the wave or of the other possibility of a hypothetical cosmic nomadic force that once embraced the galaxy before leaving off, to let this galaxy develop far faster than nature ever would have allowed for. The Crusis Wave was responsible for the [[Glinnvyr]] being so advanced, as the wave just by being noticed spurred things otherwise deeply unlikely for the ice worlders. Other civilizations heard the wave, the sprawl has many records on it. [[Tarpoids]] blamed it for the Laronian disaster. Regardless, these civilizations… were lost.

[The Lost Epoch (63200-51000 BP)

The early communities of beings known as Salfluers, Zarathustra and the creators of the Harlapans were the progenitors of multiple strange societies aside from the [[Harlapa]]- The [[Vays]] had originated as a form of artificial plasmoid life they made that run rampant across many stars. An ancient hegemony known as the Pantheon may also have existed at this time, but it collapsed and was a victim of the Tarpoids and/or the revolts of their clients. Very few wormholes from them remain. These lost communities appearantly were mostly lost to the Tarpoids, of which may have done some seriously deadly stuff. Or they lost themselves at some ancient lost conflict. Whatever the case, the Tarpoids were left as the sole hegemonic space faring entity in the galaxy. The tech of the time period got to pretty much around what is seen in the modern architect societies. The galactic core has a birch world descended from these societies, it is not clear why they don’t expand out from the core. The main theory is they somehow are linked to the andromeda and some larger intergalactic system, but there isn’t proof of this especially given how no radical reactions happened from the Ecumenical’s quarantining of the [[Virgo]] entities to the core.

The point:

-A mechanism for the Vays and harlapa being consistent

-An alt. Route for the Virgo origin, especially if they’re built up on to some usable civilization instead of untouchable.

[Tarpoid Dominion (51000 - 37000 BP)

The Tarpoid dominion was a time period where Tarpoids roamed and grew in the galaxy mostly unnoticed, with the Dioviermes first being space faring at the time. Other entities like the Vays and their emerging offshoot and the hiders of the lost communities also were present. Contact with the Tarpoids occurred from a wormhole, it was tense, the Dioviermes somehow were able to overthrow the Tarpoids through clever use of their tech with the Folders, Archivers and Ecumenicals as the troika of [[Diovierme]] dominated factions that would form the Ecumenical Era [Diovierme emergence was in 37000 BP]. Tarpoids are strange in tech spectra, their genetic systems basically to a point they were able to encode themselves into celestial bodies and nebulae somehow. Tarpoids seem to have been extragalactic and other tarpoid populations are believed to exist in other galaxies. The possibility more Tarpoids intrude is unclear and no sign of this occurring anytime soon has been found.

Purpose:

-Explaination as to why residual Tarpoids exist all over the galaxy

-More hinting at the greater fold of existence, the simmiform manifestations the Tarpoids can induce to collapse civilizations is a terrifying device without really any understanding of how it even works.

-Tarpoids may or may not be some eldritch horror, or just overhyped void ecologies. No one is clear on the matter.

-Some sprawl species were integrated from tarpoid conflicts, “liberated” from the tarpoid minds in the void ecologies and living stars they spread.

-The Tarpoid mind, were not a unified force.

[Ecumenical Era (37000 BP-9250 BP)

During the ecumenical era, the Ecumenical faction carried out their project of galactic community, of which looked akin to a galactic empire especially as the Ecumenical just would purge Tons of memories of the prior eras and go about the destruction of the Tarpoids. The Vays proved too hard to uproot, as did the Virgo core they may have formed. The prominence of the ecumenical did cause lost communities to integrate, but not all of the, leaving isolated and paranoid groups in scattered parts of the galaxy. These would be hunted by the Ecumenical and Folding ones as well, however the Archivers remained adroitly neutral even as their own kind was willing to give. Their conflicts with the Virgo were especially unique, as the Virgo didn’t seem to really go on the offensive. They were supposedly contained to the core after failed attempts to siege the core by the Ecumenical. The Archivers may have some connection to that core given how it would be the conflict between the Ecumenicals and Archivists (who they saw as basically treacherous data hoarders who kept unwanted truths in existence by recording everything yet never sharing anything they recorded), but it is not clear.

Purpose:

-The Ecumenical defeated the Tarpoids and than purged them around the galaxy in a forgetting act of galactic genocide.

-Clearly dominated the galaxy, other societies being either fortified, stragglers or the Archivers and Virgo. The Folding Ones are a non-factor.

-Establishes the civilization the sprawl originated from, along with the modern state of the Archiver and Virgo isolation.

-It haunts the galaxy to the present day. The horror of the rupture, the tarpoid genocide, the revisions and distortions of history itself done over the millennia, the integration and assimilation of many species and societies in simulated form..

The sprawl is fucking cursed and vast. Ah inescapable terrain that looks across the galaxy, the corpse of a dead giant.

-Ecumenical colonization and percolation is on a scale larger than usual. The sprawl clusters are the legacy of the hyperspatial realm building and clustered colonization strategies of the Ecumenical.

[Post-Rupture (9250-0 BP)

Multiple civilizations emerged in the galaxy in short order after the ecumenical’s collapse. These civilizations would find the sprawl and it’s hard realities instead of the prosperous ecumenical, but the vastness of sprawl worlds cannot be ignored.

Purpose:

-Without the ecumenical around and the sprawl insular, indifferent and fragmented multiple upstart civilizations grew out from their home world.

-These upstarts to have very radically different visions for the universe than the ecumenical’s visions of a prospering galactic civilization, the Milky Way as a galactic state that is managed and developed by benevolent elder alpha entities who knew best. The managed galaxy.

-Needless to say, the Architects and their vision of structural harmonics and ascension, prospect spacers entropic ecologies or civic legalism all run counter to that. Yet some of the less inward sprawl entities still seek to manipulate them towards the “rebirth” of galactic civilization instead of the squabbles of petty interstellar societies. Other sprawl entities saw them with more negative light, the scavenging animals run amok. Most populations of the sprawl just kept inwards, being automata maintaining the surviving megastructures or denizens preoccupied with sprawl unification. A coalition of sprawl entities could in theory beat down an upstart. In practice such coalition is never tenable, as sprawl Unity is just not much a thing despite the ambitions of the outer nexus and the bitterness of the aborted rebirth that happened around 4100 BP has lingered to the immortal beings of the sprawl.

The Three takeoffs:

-Virgo Ascension (The linking to some higher entity of this universe. No one is clear on this one, it is called Virgo Ascension because it would seem some members of the lost communities connected to something called the Virgo where they built a birch world that may just be one neuron for a vast intergalactic super consciousness, the societies in this galaxy just bacteria in proximity of it).

-Entropic Ascension (What the composers work towards)

-Multiversal Ascension (what the [[Custodians]] claim to achieve)

-Postmaterial Ascension (what the Archivers and potentially others Archived)

-Hypermaterial Ascension (what the ecumenical achieved)
