2385 - The Rogue Architect becomes public knowledge from leaks, forcing the Rogue Architect to fake a suicide. Regardless it would be known by the custodians of its existence in this civilization.

2740 - The Silent Pact became the de facto dominant Civic society, a quiet hegemony

**The Rise of the Plexus**

The rise of the plexus was marked in the chaos of factional conflict which erupted after the downfall of the Vanguard. The tech for mind uploading and AGI had existed for some time but the rapid expansion of its application happened with the factional conflicts as the desire for strategic advantage grew. In this came virtual apparatuses that were initially a part of the factions, they were nationalist in structure. However this would not last as the virtuals started to spread to other networks and systems, at first it was a subterfuge/subversion game competing virtuals engaged in- but than a misaligned diplomacy began to happen behind the scenes of large conflicts like the Klus Invasion of Sol or the Regnant-Consortium wars. The Reginald revolution against the Regnant in the wake of those wars led to the birth of what became the Greater Systems Assembly, the nepotistic aristocracy replaced by a trilateral cyborg hierarchy with populist characteristics. Another war of unification happened under their leadership, bolstered by the Consortium unraveling from guild-caste conflict and the Eridanis, along with the Virtue Coalition's rise in sectors in the other side of human dominated space. Eventually the Virtue Coalition, made of those who uploaded due to the collective trauma of the Golden Swarm of which the Greater Systems Assembly only sent some support in handling would come to deadlocked conflict against the Greater Systems Assembly. It was in this consolidating environment the Plexus formulated more rapidly due to the destruction of server complexes from these wars causing need for a unified front separate of the cyborg warlords that seemingly dominated humanity. The Plexus in 2630 became a formal entity that both the Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition recognized, indeed this is why 2630 is regarded as the start of the current Plexus era. The chaos of the 2500's had come to a close. But there was still other societies out there including the Estate and the Solar Union, along with the ticking time bomb that would be the alien forces in the galaxy. Be it the obvious danger of alien imperialists posed by Prospect Space or the eldritch forces at play elsewhere. The Plexus arose in part to be a force which could organize against these dangers. And in part as the neutral virtual space between the exceedingly tense Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition whose deep rift simply wouldn't mend. The Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition sought to reunify humanity under their way of existence, and see the other power as the only thing in the way of that.
