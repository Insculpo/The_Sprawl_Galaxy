[[Tikali]] Pods

-Promoli Pod / Promoli League

[Or the pod of spikes.  They are one of the most disturbed pods, their mass impalements during the tendril schisms that led to the rise of the neomush continue to become more molecular, with their belief in thegreat sublime.  They managed to develop the Hypernauts.  They were a newer pod, forming with the great dive from many smaller pods into the spikes of promoli.  They are the main rogue pod, despised by a lot of Tikali for good reason.  Humans and Natvyr have taken some as refugees, but needless to say their rather spiky ways make them hard for other sapients to work with.

-Udonip Pod

[The more enigmatic ones


-Minavan Pod

[The great pod of [[Minava]] and ancient rival of the Tulso, they have managed some of the greatest computational advancements.  They also have the most stakes in conflict, they are basically the most powerful tikali society from an conventional standpoint having in the minds of their engineers, oculars, depth seekers and technocrats broken to a higher plane of existence.  One of many coterminous flows, instead of the singular tendrils of their peers.  The Assembly and VC see them as an existential threat due to the willingness to play with fire in regards to sprawl tech, but they also see each other that way and despite these tensions have managed to virtualize enough to connect their pods to the Plexus.  They are one of the only tikali societies that can be said to truly rival the human super powers.

-Sarso Pod

[Once the pride of the Tikali, the betrayed tendril once had been a flowering force.  They were actually pretty effective at sociology and managed tendril systems, indeed the Sarso pod was the architect of the neomush and Imarsa being from the Sarso pod was no coincidence.   They are currently not significant a pod, since they go to the SJU.

-Juluso Pod

[Rogue pod, tendrils intertwined with the Sarso who have gone mad

-Vikla's Pod

[[[Prospect Space]] compromised pod, hosting composer and [[Metasyndicate]] tech.   They have managed to be part of the Promoli, the pod deemed most desperate by the Metasyndicate.  Members of other major prospect space groups have also appeared but the metas have been the most prominent and intrusive of the groups.  [[Mediators]] and Urzine have been mostly sending observers and hunters (sometimes a prospect spacer tries to hide in another civilization cluster)
