Harmonic thought is a system of attitudes and beliefs based on the idea of civilization being in effect an illusion, and that it is an emergent produce of increased entropy to which all life aspires.  It is not entropy worship in the classic sense,  as there is a directive in harmonic thought towards a balanced melody of meta stability.  Instead it is a form of controlled chaos where societies exist within a simple framework without much security and with harmonic agents (or composers as they're often called) influencing these organizations on a regular basis.  Harmonics are oriented on metaphysical commentaries which mainly are obsessed with discussing the fluctuations of social patterns and the quantities of emergence which they have.  Another aspect of harmonics is its expansionist desire to break overly stable, dead societies in order to give them life.  Or, stable empires are viewed as unnatural by harmonicism and must be broken apart so they may regain dynamism.
