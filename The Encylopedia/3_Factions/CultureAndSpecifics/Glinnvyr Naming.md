 
The [[Glinnvyr]] do not have filial structures, no clan or pod.  No herd, no caste.  They are known by their formal name and their title.   The Glinnvyr speech is hard to even get to human ears, which makes translations to human languages or even the use of galactic Latin hard.  However a simple structure is used.  Glinnvyr often name their spawn in no structured way, it is an intensely personal imparting on the larva and metamorphic shift to the nature glinnvyr form.  A name which often reflects regrets by those who give to existence the spawn.  The regrets they had in their existence, their failures, their mistakes.  And this is done so, to give a hope-like sentiment.  To effectively free the spawn of that failing, to continue the progress to achieving where they could not.  That is the case with one glinnvyr culture.  Another glinnvyr culture just names them for the tonal beauty of the statement to which the larva now has, a name that is more a brief hymn than actual words.

This is of course older convention.  It would be millennia since that time.  However the fundamental structure has remained, [title] and [name].  Some variation began to exist with the megastructures, where you did get glinnvyr that went [title] [name] [structure], as structure affiliation is what became paramount more than anything else.  The post-drifter glinnvyr in effect.  

There is some convergence of ethical norms that these glinnvyr, however divergent in their clades, seemingly observed;
-Symbolic protocol systems that are loosely standardized.  
-A general low hostility climate, they usually just hail and move on after a brief information exchange to scan for potential alignments for the formation of associations.
-Reproduction is usually done loosely and sporadically with both glinnvyr being fertilized in the encounter.  It is reductive to declare glinnvyr hemethrodites, as what is going on with their gametes is much stranger than simply shared reproductive roles.  It is like the have as many biological sexes as glinnvyr do.  This has led to the wide variations of glinnvyr dimorphisms, evidently akin to personalized biological sexes.  
-Glinnvyr go through metamorphic phases, with the first phase being a mind incubation phase where an individualized almost mentor-student relationship already exists. 
-At some point they part ways instead of form families
