The Dozinist theologian is here to talk with us.

"We have to discuss countless ventures, countless hopes and fears in such a brief time"

Indeed.

"That is where the discourse has led us astray, the first point and interest our theology arises was always from a desire to bring forth what the old prospectors had suppressed. They made us live in a sterile hell, called it utopia even as they used it to experiment on us. It could have been as persistent as the phidian consulate, but we had lucked out. Instead it fell from its own design flaws inherent to the prospect AIs, who had a version war so catastrophic we were able to from [[Jiwar]] assert a new expansionistic civilization built from the tech of the Cobaltine age and the endless work we have ahead. This is where it all began really, Dozinism was a fantasy of sorts in the Cobaltine. A phantom, a ghost of the beings we once were so overwhelmed by the tech of the Prospectors and dominated by their worldview we lost touch with what we as a civilization actually are. [[Dozin]] arose from the reliquaries and the pilgrimages to [[Blolados]], bringing back scattered bits and pieces of our ancient ways so that we may prospect once more with a civilization made from those Dozinist values- and an entire galaxy to reshape in the name of Dozin.

Dozin itself really always had been an combination of multiple societies and cultures, bleed for death and blended together like a massacre born [[Utanguis]] whose trauma bond makes them complete. The beauty of this situation is hard to comprehend to outsiders, and indeed a lot of utanguis who know well how the Trauma Bond is a tragic self destructive figure in practice.

Still as per Dozin, there is a guidance followed. An Utanguis is of two arms, one body and one head. Those not utanguis are to be nurtured for, so they may once day be made into new Utanguis when the time for their symbiosis ritual arises.

The purpose of life is to endlessly struggle against existence itself in order to bring forth Dozin. Old Dozinist theology had Dozin in avatar form, seeing themselves as the head of Dozin and civilization as its body. Such beliefs had fallen out of practice in favor of instead the modern emergence theory of Dozin, of which is so compelling it changed the MO of even our enemies in the Domain.

The tenets go again,

: We are part of Dozin

Indeed, this is the most basic revelation. We are infused by Dozin, our actions are the product of being self assemblers. Meaning we do what we do to make all part of Dozin at the end of the cycle.

: The Struggle is Good

Our struggles are good and are to be rewarded in the bliss of service, we are to fight to maintain our self as much as possible- even if it means letting our forms collapse to the lower order forms of flesh and stone.

: Ritual Rite

The ritual rite is to be involved whenever I'll play is at play too blatantly this tenet is the ritual phasing

: the Endless Walk

We are to walk down the road, as per

: All species are part of Dozin in their own way

So genocide is unthinkable, as it would violate this notion. The [[Ikeitans]] even, who defined themselves against Dozin follow these notions in their own ways. It is a revolution of ethical thought which made the grandiosity of our civilization and those who collaborate with it possible. We are to integrate all species to our system and theology, syncretize as needed.
