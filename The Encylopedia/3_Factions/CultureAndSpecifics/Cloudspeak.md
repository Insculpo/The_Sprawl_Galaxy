Cloud speak is a whispy language which originated from the [[Sarkic]].  Unlike the concept heavy gestalt languages, cloud speak has a more fluid approach

Cloud speak is a volumetric script so the 2d plane can't properly get it since the flow of the "wisp" line which interconnects the script that in paper terms is a single unbroken scribble-like line whose repeated patterns make up the overall composition.

Flows:

1- Rigid flows for more commanding and transactional communication flux

2- Wavy flows for more formal kinds of communication, emotive and causal

3- Harsh wavy flows are somewhere in between, often associated with anger and hostility, pain or otherwise upset/fear.  Harsh states of mind

Sample bits:

Greeting forms in English terms

Rigid: "entry granted"

Wavy: "Welcome inside"

Hard waves: "You dare entered"

Flow direction matters in relative terms.

Towards flow variations
