The [[Ikirmite]] have as a civilization become embedded in multiple affinities produced by their biological heritage as a chemotrophic and heterotrophic organism.  The architecture is extremely writhing and dull of spiny lights.  

There are a several norms and ontological aspects to the ikirmites which I have to seriously consider for this to work.

For one the Ikirmites are beings who existed only in abyss, with semiotic signals as their guidance and that led to a civilization where such semiotic shepherding is everywhere and used for a vast range of applications.  Of which include the natural world and its shifting relations to the numerous inner circles and outer circles of organized activities by the ikirmites.

The Ikirmites in terms of being "structured" have been mostly defined by an economy of semiotics with hidden meanings and values beyond which the usual comprehensions we go by just don't fit well.  It is easy to reduce it to special keys, phrases or terms but ultimately what it actually compels itself as are much greater, non-analogous comprehensions of the obtuse.  The Ikirmites have to keep on trotting about, for they must live in the abyss of a world abandoned by its own solar system.  A snowball world.  That aspect of their existence was only known later, but the secretive and tense aspects of ikirmite existence came about due to the limitations a lack of sunlight imposed.  Why they had to make use of both an autotrophic and heterotrophic mode of life.  Why they had gained chemotrophic qualities.

All of which is part of their day to day life where despite advanced automation mechanisms and industrialized aquaculture with specialized monitoring computers used as part of the greater corpus of technological feats.

Ikirmite psychology is understood mainly in the mixed messages of their own folds.  The entropic decline of resources, especially in the wake of the Breachers had been the collective trauma which gave contrext to the existence of the Ikirmites.   The Cryptics and Flowing, the Venters and the Convectives are the lose names given to four major groups.  

*Cryptics*

Cryptics are the numerous associations of encrypted entities, often found holed about in numerous nooks and crannies of the molded core matter used to create spindly structures where volumetric alcoves in deep lounges slowly meander.  The cryptics have no unity, they can't actually tell half of what is going on due to the discrete approach to cross-group interactions they had continued on with.  They have lots of accumulated wealth through trade secrets and research groups setup by the local flow where semiotic intracies enabled a sort of re-invention.

*Flowers*

The Flowing are the common Ikirmites in some regards, they tend to all matter of issues and mostly are a merchantile class and had been since the past.  Due to their lack of secrets compared to the cryptics, they are regarded as foolish and incapable of keeping a secret which is usually not seen as what the ideal ikirmite is like.  One day they're supporting the Void Divers, the next they are being a lesser form of the Cryptics.  They are the most playful group, at least with regards to continuous play.  The Flowing are not the same as the saturated, they usually did come from the vent gardens instead of the seeps.  

*Venters*

The Venters are usually associated with hydrothermal vents where nursers, prospectors and the like still slightly involved.  They tend to the sessile larvae of the ikirmites but are seen elsewhere, even seconding an addigtional round of actions.  

*Convectives*

Convectives are more nomadic, sparses and not fun to come across.  They managed a lot of the innovations for countering the breacher probes during the breacher war and the later revolution against the Void Divers.  

**Factional development dynamics** 

Ikirmite social structures are embedded and linked chains where tight knit "conspirators" work on all matter of activities in the interest of their groupings.  These groupings get called a range of things, with the loose translation to plexus universal being jarring at best to those unfamiliar with the way semiotics and tonal intensities of brightness encode meaning in ikirmite existence.

The use of visual language is perhaps a bit on the the surface with it, but it is the most straightforward analog available.

Affinities 

Ikirmites of shared proclivities that sort themselves into Spheres of Affinities.  Affinities unify other ikirmites in the group through shared affinity, they are most like a club of sorts.  Often the shared affinity is an interest or cause, but it also can often be a greater project the affinity may in some cases work towards for centuries with generational efforts contained within the affinity as the secrets and scandals stay in the abyss.  Affinities can collapse, information leaks that undermine the faith in the affinity, disillusionment from realizing the construction project they spent centuries on had no future after all, fear/distrust of others in the affinity outweighed the passion of action.  The most powerful affinity in modern times is known collectively as [[The Manifold]].

*The failure of the pan-ikirma convection project*

In the pre-contact era, [[Ikirma]] was a bustling world with countless population centers and vast networks of trade the flowing ones and convectives were facilitating.  Dreams of a grand transit system across entire latitudes through redirected currents started to manifest as the usual megafaunal transits were regarded as unable to handle the populations of Ikirmites which began to exist by 2000 AD.  The Ikirmites after all, were not small.  They were 30 feet from the tip of the 'crown' to the the tip of the lower tentacles.  Such sizes meant each Ikirmite was an investment, as they took decades to mature and aggregate the connections needed to function in the greater networks of activity.  The time spent cultivating an Ikirmite in the ventgarden, the time spent training them, the time spent integrating them to the local social structure all were shared experiences across much of the world even if the conflict of flow vs cyptics continued to haunt the globalizing dynamic which the Ikirmites were dealing with in those times.

Silent killings of those in the affinity by others in the affinity by the more sociopathic members for instance roiled an affinity which tried to make convectional transit systems only to have conflicts of interest over which clusters to prioritize in the current spiral into assassinations in response to suspected kleptomania/corruption of the affinity.

Contrasts - Contrasts are antiunions that are in constant rivalry but with a clear inability to exist without the continued existence of the other, to the point there is support that gets given to the other side of the contrast should the need arise.  The Contrasts are effectively beings locked in an intentional ritual form of warfare that is less about winning or losing and more about maintaining a constant sense of self by defining the self against the other, feeding off each other in a toxic dependency that ensures a purity of the path they have set for themselves.  In practice they fall apart all the time, sometimes splitting or merging into affinities or otherwise simply disintegrating into Flows once more.  Such Contrasts have continued to astound those around everyone in their ability to be weirdly stable despite the chaotic lightshows they produce.

Saturations - Saturations are the names given to a rarer formulation seen mostly in the open abyss regions where cold seeps were the best one could usually do.  Much more spread out and without the prism hierarchy of the contrasts and affinities, the saturations were looser.  They didn't intensively cultivate their young to the horror of the other populations- they just let the sessile larvae form and develop with minimal intervention and if they failed, they failed.  If they lived, they lived.  Such lifestyle is usually seen as outmoded and an artifact of older existence, but it is hardly such to the Saturations.  For the Saturated do raise their members in a wide range of ways, with the intensity varying with the temperament of the Saturated Circles in question.  A series of different mentorships with different perspectives is expected.  They are not nearly as cryptic as the other populations, sharing knowledge is the norm with them.  Which to other ikirmites makes them idiots.  The saturations still have managed to be uniquely able to manage a vast range of solutions to problems compared to the conditional supports and narrow response ranges / hammer approaches preferred by other groups.  

All in all these three classes of social structure show a broad diversity of ikirmite characters are possible even with the morphology and biology they go by.


Xenosociological Geometrics
A made up term that basically is a mean of social analysis by the "shape" of social structures a species forms.  Pyramid structures of varying steepness are the most common, but prism structures do occur at times.  Some are genuine places while others have a very steep central spike,  Others still are less linear hierarchies but shifting waves of local dominance or multiple pyramids deviating from each other.  Various sapient entities prefer certain geometrics over others for better or worse.

With the Ikirmites, prism structure instead of pyramid structure is the norm.  Flatter systems exist like with the Venters and Concectives who operate autonomously of their Flowing and Cryptic co-dominated metropoles that often form in outer fractal rings around geological hotspots.  Such cities are not deterministic- there are population centers which line rifts or are embedded into the cliffsides of trenches especially in the regions of Ikirma where sunken continental plates create such large rift regions.  The Ikirmites have a surprising amount of verticality to their movement with different populations centered around different depth regions on their homeworld.
