Prospect Spacers are the main antagonistic alien civilization, their operations and behavior are an intricate mesh work of countless factors that create the vast leviathans which percolate from the volume in a disturbingly expansionistic fashion.

This is because of the deeper interlocking systems at play. Within prospect space there are the leviathans, but there are also a multitude of large organizations which interconnect between them with more specialized activities and identities some more parasitic than others to the greater system. These entities are seen as part of [[Dozin]]'s formation, just as countless other cellular parts. All forming the machinations of the cosmic god being known as Dozin. That is the conceit of the neodozinists, who used to see Dozin as ethereal- until the fall of the Immortal Avatar and the Vusidian Dominion as a whole caused a spiritual reckoning that radiated across countless worlds reflecting the violence of the packmasters and the various renegade power players who would hit a sudden halt with the custodians invasion. The custodians had sought to contain the mess, but alas they had quickly went to massacring when the "corruption and destitution" of these aliens proved too much- they used xenoforming WMDs with a disturbing aggressiveness.
