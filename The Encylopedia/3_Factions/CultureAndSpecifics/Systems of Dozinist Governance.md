Prospect Space governing systems

-Dozinist Systems

[Hierarchical Meritocracy / Pack Oligarchy



Symbiosis addiction is a common problem in Prospect Space, made worse by how their very religions enable and support it.  Imagine if Christianity lionized those who did cocaine as closer to god.  That is the kind of problem which has occurred. Not helping is how symbiosis does provide net advantages in breaking through the ranks. 

Pack rank is achieved through a wide range of means, the generalism of the Mediators has void ecology engineering, struggle road pavers, theologians, symbiont researchers, weapon developers, ecologists, species integrators, infiltrators, servicers and so forth as fields which are filled by the vast populations of Prospect Space.  Void ecology engineers remain a heavily prestigious field, as much as the diplomatic class of the Mediator gestalt is.

Mediator Gestalt space force profile

-A packmaster is assigned, with lesser masters often accompanying them in an officer like fashion.  They carry out staged battles with the enemy, with highly destructive weaponry reserved for when the rules of the game are being violated.  This includes the reserved use of extremely dangerous biomechanical war machines known as Redeemers and the antiparticle/nanite weaponry Utanguis boneships sometimes carry in secret (at times given tech as part of a secret plot to use the chaos of a space conflict to ursurp power from the packmaster) instead of the usual plasma weaponry.

-Integrated military units are made use of, with a flexible sense of operations due to the bulk of combat work being secretly done by infiltrators to subterfuge and undermine their opponents before the actual staged battles can commence.  These infiltrators more often are utilized against enemies who they know do not play on Dozinist terms- something even the bioships do despite being in theory, antidozinist (the nature of Urzine misothiesm is bizarre).

-Assault forces made of powerful vessels who fight through the battles and are the leading wave, with the secondary wave of support vessels in tow.

-Media crews are always on site, with the intention of collecting the footage for all matter of sources ranging from propaganda curators to snuff purveyors with unnervingly high quality.  Much of the footage is often run through stylization filters and emphasis given by producers to create variations of the event to emphasize best what their clients want. 

Utanguis in short are meant to be a subversion of the warrior race, a fallen corrupt order who only follow the rules they set because not following them means horrifying underhanded biotechnological abominations get released in retaliation.  They play underhanded tactics all the time in practice, with even their prestigious space fleets and face-face combatants being mainly to knock down the foundation eroded in advance.
