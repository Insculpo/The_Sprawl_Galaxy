The Cinderists are another group in [[The Phidian Shell]] that the Counsulate is highly hostile towards, as they were a cult who existed too far out of the reach of unification and continued to nomadically spread while the Consulate conquered most of their settlements later on.  But their beliefs lived on and affect the colonies heavily, who often have become used to drugging themselves with different mind altering substances than the ones which are officially sanctioned for the group.  Cinderists groups are very materialistic as far as they go and Cinderism is so widespread in modern times the Consulate has partially adapted the belief system despite the Klaconist faction's total hostility to the deviants- as it is believed conformity and unity to the Consulate matters more than ideological conformity, and so many elites tried to make both work even as persecution happens at the same time.  The Cindering is an ideology based around mutilation and hope from mutilation.  The state of hopeful harm, so to speak- mutilation is a highly sexual act for them, peeling and cracking being of deeply liberating of the core self locked away by the confirms of natural laws- where rep fiction is a must, death must be feared and one must consume.  Active defiance of nature is a massive cultural drive of theirs, with a many zealots fasting, risking their lives regularly and having sex for the sake of sex- not in the name of having children and all of this is viewed as a logical conclusion of the distorting nature to fit Phidian existence Klaconism promotes even if Klaconists believe Phidian nature shouldn't be modified at all.
