Timekeeping in the [[Grand Assembly]]

The Grand Assembly has a tendency towards making a time keeping system where life is meaningful again. The standard was established in 2630, making use of post-Terracentic understandings of time for interstellar travel and activities. Much of which was needed due to how local planetary timekeeping was way too scattered and localized to be of use and forcing earth time onto everything proved to be too unwieldy.

So interstellar timekeeping had developed in the late 22nd century, with intent of it being galactic time. One of the first peculiarities of the calendar is how it breaks with earlier European influences by centering the calendar around a "global" event in the form of the first successful use of a warp drive. Hence the BW/AW year convention which is set to the year 2120. Right now is 98 BW for reference. The epoch year is 680 AW.

The universal time metric is distinct in how it makes use of a decimated time convention loosely inspired by the French Revolution, but modernized for the modern context.

An interstellar year still follows 365.25 days and an earth orbit per year (mainly due to Vanguard clout), with more radical calendars trying to make a pulse defined as 100 hours, meaning a cycle is 10000 hours. Under that nomenclature a pulse is rounded up to 4.17 days, a year is rounded to 417 days. But this convention isn't often used due to the tedium of squaring it with ancient calendars and many just liking the idea of an earth orbit representing a cycle. However it is divided into 100 "pulses", of which are 3.65 days each. Little over half a week. There are 100 pulses per cycle. These pulses get months, of which are called months despite no relationship to lunar cycles to speak of. There are 10 pulses per month and 10 months per cycle. The calendar reads "05.09" or 59 pulses. With it being month 5. The need for months is mainly because it helps with time organization, as a "month" is 36.5 days on average in this system. Warp times also were from a time when a "Month" is

Interstellar standard timing therefore would say the present date is [03.07 98 BW]
