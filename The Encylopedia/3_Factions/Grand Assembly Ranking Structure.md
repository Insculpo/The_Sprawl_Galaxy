-The United Assembly Fleets- (The UAF)

The UAF is a military force built and standardized from the multiple sub factions that allied into the Assembly as a part of the greater unification of the unstable factions that were predicted to cause incomprehensible degrees of mass death for human civilization and likely replacement with virtue gestalts and vopson swarms if they did not unify in some hardened form.  The UAF simply started as the military force of the inited technobarbaric forces, a coalition military pact that drew forces from a vast army of volunteers who had by this point become committed to the cause.  Yet since even a small share of their world's populations was enough to amass massive armies descended from not only populous worlds in the colonies but also from virtual minds who remember the pain and death the golden swarm caused in hypervivid detail they projected as propaganda to those to see the fate of those who fail to know the stakes.  The unification process was also motivated by the dread felt over the virtue coalition and the ongoing work into Sprawl worlds causing widespread panic.  As no cohesive government existed, the revelations of the sprawl found at [[Gilizet]] in the 2550's and the Ramos annihilation at a similar time led to a lot of justified fear that the golden swarm was nothing compared to what else is out there in a galaxy that had rapidly gone from a silent realm to stake control over to full of dangerous noise.  [[The Sprawl]] had been known of for 5 centuries.  It was figured dead when they never made contact.  Than the Gilizet explorations unveiled disturbing truths on the Sprawl, be it what the Kavadans were up to at the Crab Nebula or the various entities of the Unadopian worlds.  A civilization that wanted us to come to them.  Needless to say such offers tempted.  As did the increasing activities of other alien entities all everywhere.  Vanguard worked hard to blind everyone to them, but such work had collapsed.  Everyone knew for sure now.  Before there was many who knew but those who could see an alien in front of them and claim it just some bioengineering stunt.  The [[Custodians]] that began to patrol the volumes, the prospect spacers who carry out a range of dubious activities- worsened by the revelation they are the society  the golden swarm had fled.  Worse still, the custodians who had followed them here.  All in all, with these realities faced the consolidation of many world states into a vast defense fleet was much desired.  The Assembly forces would in the 2600's with the UAF mostly shift to a paradigm of more quality ships to technologically compete against prospect spacers, keep matched against the Vapourites and keep a quality edge over the VC.  This led to a cleaving between the UAF core fleet and the militia forces that came to be more loyal to world ministries.  This divide happened fast- by the 2650's when internal divisions continued to cause some to lose faith in the cause of the Assembly and the vision of a society built on the preservation of individual agency and a legal code that ensures it is immune from the encroachment of the VC or the caprice of [[Metasyndicate]].  Such agency oriented thinking caused this split almost to be one that was pragmatic- to keep two powerful branches of the Assembly able to even with hard power hold the other branch to account.  The balancing act was compounded by virtuals, but virtuals generally were seen more for their intelligence agency roles more than their combat roles, with virtuals into combat just joining the UAF or system militias if not other associations like the Mega Unions,local companies and so forth. 

ADV (Assembly Defense Vessel)

UAF (Unified Assembly Fleet)

Rank-wise in their interstellar defense forces as follows:

[High Command (the fleet council elects the grand representative of the unified assembly fleets to the assembly)

The UAF is ran by a military council of their top commanders, selected from their veteran commanders who have seniority.  This system is a stratocratic oligarchy, where the 7 members of High Command work to advance the interests of the UAF as a branch and organ of the Assembly as a whole.  They are who other officials within the UAF go to in order to arbitrate on matters of high wisdom.  They also vet the candidates for the UAF’s prime representative of the Assembly and direct the whole Assembly fleet forces.  Chief Fleet Commanders and PR representatives at times have been chosen as the UAF’s prime representative, so one does not have to be in high command to be a prime representative.  Only be someone  who has shown diligent service to the UAF and has impressed upon high command their value in promoting the interests of the UAF in the Assembly.

[Chief Fleet Commander

Master fleet commands are much like the major and minor commanders, but with the additional factor that they answer very directly to high command itself.  Indeed they are basically admirals In naval terms and at times get called admirals, despite how archaic it is to do so when plenty of worlds have navies as is.

[Major Fleet Commander

Major fleet commanders operate much as minor ones, but with authorization to utilize a range of scorched world protocols should the need arise.  They usually are elaborate inner minds that play out thousands of scenarios for any action they take.  As at the scales they operate at, a misstep can be utterly cataclysmic.

[Minor Fleet Commander

Fleet commander operate on the grander scale strategies, as they deal with the command operations of fleet actions on the interstellar scale.  For this reason and the complexities needed, fleet commanders are extremely augmented ship minds integrated with multiple predictive networks and personal judicator systems along with even specialized asters for logistical matters and the likelihood diplomatic integrity comes into play at a local system.  Fleet commanders and Sargents can also assist local worlds and systems in local operations, with taking command at times occurring much to the resentment of a local government.  Such command can risk castor manifestations (as taking command often means overriding local policy and diversion of industry to the UAF stationed there, SO THEY BETTER HAVE VERY GOOD REASON TO ASSERT THOSE POWERS) and so they try to keep to a light touch and deal making with the local government and working with propaganda departments as needed if there is a sufficiently vindictive cause to flip public sentiment to the side of the fleet that has taken temporary command of their system or otherwise have negotiated the stationing of UAF ships in their system (of which at times is welcomed).

[Chief Sargent  (or Space Deputies)

Master Sergeants usually control their ships along with a large force of higher order spaceships and delegate sergeants who handle further autonomous actions.  Master Sergeants usually host the local judicator system and are seen as equals to it, even if it is very much a teaming of the Hard logic of the AI and the sentimentalities/willingness to take risks of the master Sargent to allow for a less than standardized system of command that is believed to maximize the due diligence and character of the agents within the fleet.  It also allows for a flexible chain of command, as the Judicator proxies itself to the ships under the Master sergeant’s command as needed. 

[Major Sargent

Major Sergeants are advanced cyborgs with both automata and cyborg ships under their command.  Major Sergeants have more direct jurisdiction over captains than minor Sergeants do.  Master captains they usually are teamed with in order to preserve the strategic capabilities of the Sargent with the competence of a high ranking captain.

[Minor Sargent

Sergeants are as a rank in the context of UAF ranks, a

Sergeants control smaller fleet detachments than the fleet commanders.  They are asterism groups basically, part of a larger fleet constellation controlled by the fleet commanders.  Minor sergeants usually can handle fifty ships and often share command with a major captain.  They usually are re authorized to use drone swarms and act as a deputy for a judicator at this point. 

[Chief Captain

MASTER Captains ARE TASKED WITH PILOTING CAPITAL SHIPS AND HIGH CLASS, EXPERIMENTAL VESSELS OR OTHER SUCH SPECIAL PROJECTS WHERE THE BEST TALENT IS VIRWED AS CRITICAL TO SUCCESS. 

[Major Captain

Major captains are tasked with command of not just larger ships but at times specialized ships that the enhancements of major captains are often needed to handle properly. 

[Minor Captain

Minor captains are tasked with the command of smaller ships and such that are qualitatively good but not the highest vessels the UAF has at their disposal.  Minor captains also may be tasked within larger ships.  Minor captains like a lot of captains tend to have additional mind augmentation upgrades to better comprehend the volumetrics of space navigation, strategy and logistics. 

[Chief Ship Operative

Master Operatives usually only are alone in a ship unless it is a larger capital ship where multiple masters are needed.  Master operatives often do act as a second in command to the captain of a spacecraft. 

[Major Ship Operative

major Ship Operatives usually are the heads of local assignments at tasks the master operative sets for them.  They are often expected to do double duty as operatives and as leaders in their first test of leadership and showing they have it. Major operatives usually are the node readers of local BCI networks as well.

[Minor Ship Operative

This list does not do what ship operatives are justice as the operatives are usually expected to deal in the capacity their roles have of them.       Upgrading to BCI is generally done if there is no BCI interfacing already.  Operatives usually are split into technical, diplomatic, engineering, medical and analytical operations.

[Trainee

Trainees start off mainly as interns under the supervision of the major operatives of a ship to be taught the tasks and culture of a local ship fleet so they may better acclimate into their duties in the UAF.  Trainees also often are people pending their standard fleet augmentations to handle potential issues such as spacing (where hibernation protocols can be invoked) and rapid changes in ship pressure.
