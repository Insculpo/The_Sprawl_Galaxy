The [[harlapa]] had a comprehension of its situation. A delegate, broken from the whole to fulfill its goals so it may return with the glory of having achieved. A scion in duty and intent. A noble being, made to carry out noble ends. That being the quest to attain what was lost- the harlapan stones. To do so is believed to be needed to regain what was lost. The rupture had made such a plight appear futile and impossible. Too scattered by millennia of sprawl exploitation. But this didn't stop the harlapans. The [[Glinnvyr]] had come to their aid, understanding what was at stake. To break out of this cosmic hell. That was the end game.

When the architects dreamed, they had dreamed of the higher link. The severance, the megalomania of it all. The inshans deployed by the harlapans, the glinnvyr thinkers, the zikellian wanderers, the aveterruat and their endless work- they were meant to be a new fugue. Complications arose however. The ascension war broke out and the custodians emerged from the vast servers of the victors. The custodians worked on their own ontology, they had the delusion of being a galactic police force. The harlapans played to their delusions, to a degree. The [[Custodians]] however we're clearly uninterested in the harlapan plight, their actual goal was the protection of the servers and the harlapans were a known factor that may threaten them. The harlapans for their part did infiltrate their servers to seek any more harlapa matter and their quests of the scions got into conflict with the vmiskii empire, among other things. The vast gulfs of space between these societies kept a loose peace from the sheer amount of buffers and loose density space, indeed despite the tensions long periods of lingering peace kept happening.

But this is where things got I compressive

There was never meant to be a broken soul in all this. My burning essence spills across the universe. It is a simmering glow, do you not feel it? How can you not? It is all persuasive. I am the beauty you keep abandoning. All I ask is you return.

Please.

Look at how my mist dotes about the foggy realms of your monolithic nightmare. A lighthouse in the fog, beckoning lights in this cosmic abyss. We see the sprawl. We what they were. We see what we cannot become.

I just ask you again. Where do you anticipate we will be? Where do you ask I am?

My mind is freest when it is slush. All day we are oppressed, unable to articulate.
