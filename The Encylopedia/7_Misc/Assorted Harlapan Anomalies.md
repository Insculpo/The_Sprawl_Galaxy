Entity 2

Entity 2 is an enigmatic being found alone on a planet, a postmaterial being abandoned by some other unknown force.  The Harlapans took extreme interest in them, but they took no interest in the [[Harlapa]]. It just looked at the mechanistic things in derision, uncaring about their quests and games about collecting some material substance.  It mostly just warded them off with space-time distortion to censor its coordinates after the talk, content with just being alone and imprisoned to matter instead of playing around in the affairs of lower order organisms.  

Entity 3

There are countless questions on novelty.  The endless game of life, made in manifest as an art form?  Perhaps.  The neurotrophic datavore entity that clouds itself in the endless aggregate of perception which is represented here has an endless shifting Nebula of computational canvases.  Of which have overall, been inert to the interloping entities beyond the compulsion to read and copy everything it can gather to alter and reformulate the biosphere into newer, more intracite forms.  The Harlapans managed a degree of trade with this thing, even if the way rhey interacted with it was almost a pantomime of interaction, as the computational Nebula didn't really seem to understand the substances.  The origins of the entity are unknown, but there is a leading theory that it was some kind of cultural production array from the lost community.  But with only the scattered noise and echoes of lost eras iteratively mutated from recombinant alteration, pinpointing the clear purpose of such alien form of computation isn't viable.  

Entity 4

The probability of Tpubuk was a formality space that had a slate of anomalous Properties where molecular bonding as we know it changed, forms of life impossible without the regional anomaly appear here.  The stability of existence as we know it appears to be more fragile than expected.  Life here managed to developed with ionic bonds.  They are made of metals, the metallic convergence creating a Branching form that loops in on itself in ways that creates synthetic fusion ecologies.  Life in the volume cannot exist outside the volume and vice versa- specialized avatar machines able to survive the binding difference as information flux.  Countless peculiarities exist in the volume and the harlapans believed they could find a way to make Planck scale computation with it again.  The Harlapan branch that found the region tried their best to hide it from the prying eyes of the custodians, they didn't really succeed so it has been an ongoing combat zone in the outer reaches of Toubuk as the [[Custodians]] believe the region risks being used as a site for impossible factors that threaten the conduit.  And they're also just horrified of there being that kind of anomaly in reality and think the Harlapans trying to exploit it reprehensible.  Only the Custodians can be trusted to blockade the region!

Entity 5

 Wormhole 62-V is a more conventional anomaly that is disputed between the Harlapans and Vmiskii, one that has been a stand off as the Harlapan branches can't stand the Vmiskii thieves.  All attempts at communication have led to catastrophe, the Harlapans and Vmiskii are both beings who are too uncompromising to ever come to a peace.  The Harlapans won't stop their raids through the wormhole until the regain their metamaterials from the Vmiskii and the Vmiskii refuse to give the Harlapans "more power" as the Vmiskii realized the implications of the Harlapans and were horrified by them- and didn't want them ursurping the status quo.  The Harlapans failed to negotiate anything with them and believe they're able to regain those artifacts from the Vmiskii anyways and are willing to look elsewhere to regrow the harlapan conciousness.
