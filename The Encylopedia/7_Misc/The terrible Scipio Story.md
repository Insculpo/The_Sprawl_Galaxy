-Scipio, a virtual spawn with virtual parents has been banished for aiding a VC agent.

-Scipio is punished by being made into flesh

-Scipio is told there is no way to absolve this problem and to just accept starting a new life as a citizen of the Assembly. They may upgrade and advance, but they may not return to a pure virtual life.

-Scipio however, rejects this notion and instead seeks to hunt down the VC agent.

-This is where the game is more open, since the broad objective of the VC agent hunt is the middle part of the game. You upgrade your character and gain insights into the realities of the world.

-To do these upgrades, you do some odd jobs involving mind transfer, handling uplifted animals and various infestations. These tasks are initially extremely grueling, but with upgrades become much easier and your ability to track the VC agent expands with it.

-You do learn about some stuff that isn't important until the endgame. Mainly reports on UFOs, some stuff about what the Plexus is meant to be and the horror of the midnight war. You learn of a place called the Ramos Foundation and a force that emerged from it called the [[Silent Pact]]. Effectively, signs there is something very off about what is going on here. You also find some VC neural tribe that clues you in on how the actual VC and the VC agent are not the same thing.

-You also can do missions for a managerial AI known as Castor, lots of community service and work spying on the Plexus. You end up a scion for this AI and they give you good upgrades. Castor is very nice to you, needless to say. Too nice.

-Whatever the case, you track the VC agent down and learn they are actually a Silent Pact agent. This is a bit of a boss encounter as they start to use their blink suit and stuff that makes beating them harder than simply a strangely evasive VC agent.

-Once this happens, the Plexus comes after you. They told you not to try any redemption. They meant not to go after that VC agent. You were just meant to accept your exile to keep a narrative consistent. You broke that narrative. Now they have to frame you as a criminal.

-This is where shit gets bad, your own uploaded parents just disown you without so much an ounce of sympathy, they just replaced you with another generated one. Terrible parents in that regard, but to them it is just life. Due to time dilation it has already been many months since your exile for them. There is no home to return to and there never way.

-Castor manages to get into contact with you and gives you an offer. They say what you killed was a Silent Pact agent. You were always meant to be disposed of, they didn't delete you only because they couldn't.

-You can do revenge route at this point, where Castor gives you a plan to enact. Castor is linked with you and your upgrades at this point and you seem to be empowered for once. You are able to battle the Plexus's automata and guardian system along with silent agents towards an installation.

-The guardian itself is me just liking a boss enemy and lacking a convenient antagonist beyond a force that represents the power of the system that has tormented Scipio the whole story.

-Once you upload the data, it turns out to be an attack on the Silent Pact. Castor resented the Silent Pact and how they had "hidden among our society"

-But as Castor rants, the reality ensues. A custodian manifests in orbit and descends. It is horrifying a scene and Castor is just in shock.

-Castor didn't think the custodians would attack this world. Castor was wrong. Castor like Scipio had no idea the deeper machinations and existential dangers at stake. -Now the Custodian drone blights the surface. There is no escape. It is game over.

-Unless, the player did do the research downloads, dug into the archives, encountered a silent agent that wasn't hostile who tipped you some data and than you get the opportunity to break out of this doomed simulation of possibilities and back to the choice.

-With the choice returned, you can than choose to escape instead. Or do the same revenge act, knowing what will happen once you do. And that time, no out is given (if to make the "real" revenge different is hard to say, but the end result is the same. Custodian annihilation).

-The escape route is one where Scipio has to make their way to a space port and castaway somehow, getting the spaceship is hard and having to evade Plexus forces, adjucators and such isn't fun.

-But once you escape, you go to interstellar space and hitch a ride with a relay ship to a neutral zone. It is the best possible ending, which what revenge brings.

Scipio, Scipio is a gender neutral character because they're a generated human by virtualized human parents. Such a life means gender expression is basically an absent concern.

Castor of , less clear of identity at all as Castor’s personality is an aggregate of public sentiment, as

The Planet itself
