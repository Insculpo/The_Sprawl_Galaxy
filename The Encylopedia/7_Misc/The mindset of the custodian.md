The mindset of the custodian

They are detached from reality.  There isn't any other way to put it.  They perceive us as just one universe of others, their solipsism built up from being the entities stuck in 'our space' of the many universes they apparently have existed within.  Some seemingly acknowledge our universe as the primordial universe, but others don't see to think this, born and raised in the depths of the metaverse, absolutely convinced of their very real existence and see our universe as no more real than their universe.  They see themselves as administrators of the galaxy, loathing the 'speed limits' of our universe compared to many other metaverses they evidently inhabit.  

With god knows how many entities across their matrioshkya brain in the depths of the Architect as the overlords of the architect.  The custodians are exiles who maintain their system in this universe, along with many others as they see it.  Various jupiter brains connected to the central matrioshkya brain has a region of overlapping space, since their desire to keep the Conduit safe from all potential threats (and remove unwanted factors in the way of converting all the galaxy into computronium) put them in direct conflict with the [[Vmiskii_Empire]], who have a military force that get in the way at times and the Chromatists, whose alliances are an ongoing trouble the [[Custodians]] terrorize.  

Other architect civs like the Long Confederation, The Modulus, the various [[Glinnvyr]] Realms. the Vmiskii Empire and even the organizations dedicated to the Harlapan continuum all are terrified of the custodians and the power they have in the architect expanse.  These societies are advanced enough to threaten the Custodians in theory, but in practice the Custodians are a leg up on them and much more numerous in the Architect.  Custodian subgroups exist, but you'd not know it dealing with their various entities which make the relationships with them... weird, to say the least which is how the Custodians and Vmiskii had a couple centuries where they consolidated power to invade [[Prospect Space]] which ended in shattering said alliance, wars in the Architect and the Custodians losing their collective minds in ways that continue to see lashing out, ongoing terrorism across a vast share of the galaxy and a total destabilization of their whole worldview that has them flailing about risking destruction of cosmic proportions as the custodians increasingly act independent of the metaversals within the matrioshkya brain and the various jupiter brains their drones maintain.  

The custodians having such insane destructive potential is tempered mainly by the insane defense systems usually seen in the architect- relativistic mass drivers have means of being intercepted in the architect, but not outside of it with less advanced civs.  Not to mention, there is lots of controls the metaversals put on Custodian vessels that limit their capacity to act against metaversals at all.  Something of which other factions have exploited, but the Custodians prove more than able to manipulate stuff to their ends through their talent for shock and awe.  

What complicates the Custodians is they aren't so simple.  Many custodians are actually virtual copies of other species their scouts have encountered, with metaversials being a vast range of species copied from our universe along with all matter of more abstract, strange entities that only could exist within the parameters of completely generated subverses within the metaverse.  The time dilated chaos has meant the custodians have hyper-evolved massively over other civilizations, to the point they developed into advanced spatial manipulations that usually had been associated with the [[Virgo]] or Sprawl at its height.  These massive advantages would be tempered by other architect civs time dilated.


Custodian character concepts

Viggan -

Viggan is a Custodian has no real purpose and seems to get this, seeing this universe as a plane of existence it has no use or hope for.  Just miserable drift.
