The Nomadic Exchange Thesis / The Diffusion Thesis

Core Premise: Eons of civilizations can exist within observation through civilizations of sufficient advancement reaching the optimal strategy of advanced nomads who at most, selectively colonize bright stars and supermassive black holes. 

The supporting axioms for this premise:

-The Weaknesses of current techno signature observations

-The Lopsided Distribution of matter

-Nomadic civilizations as the optimal strategy

-The periodic exchange hypothesis

-Mass formation of life

-The Interstellar WMD selection bias

-The Singleton Capriciousness Problem

-The Value of pre-interstellar life to interstellar life

-Adaptation to Space over planetary existence

-The Eon Problem

-Potential revelations of the cosmology that would further the diffusion thesis

Modeling

What the model has to show and address:

-Expansion != Observable colonization.  Density of colonization would be weak in most star systems due to the lopsided advantages star systems with OB stars and Blackholes would have over other celestial objects. 

-This means civilizations in the thin disk would aggregate in a place where they are hiding in plain sight.  These are incidentally, short lived stars that would further encourage a long term nomadic strategy.

-Such fleets would be hundreds of light years from earth and so be difficult to observe from earth without hyperprecise instruments even if it is assumed they use a torch drive, however unlikely this would be for advanced civilizations technologically ahead of human civilization for over an eon.

-The way this model considers the dynamics of advanced civilizational behaviors over eons without reliance on a crutch like a singleton hegemony.   

-How detectable would Bracewell Probes be?

The Potential Phases of Advanced Civilizations

Advanced civilizations are in this model, believed to go through multiple phases of development that leads to convergence to some optimal strategies.  While suboptimal strategies would be able to still be a large presence, they would not be the dominant presence and therefore not easily detectable.  Do not take this model as empirical, it is built on speculation and counterfactuals for one potential reality.  It could well be civilizations advance more rapidly or hit a technological mesa without any further inclines.  In effect, technology is modelled as having phased “explosions” that occur periodically.  These “explosions” are massive upheavals that fundamentally alter societal dynamics in ways that can be regarded as black swan events or even an OCP for the civilization.  As we are but planetbounders for the time, take these potential phases and pathways as a hypothetical route the majority of civilizations undergo.  Other routes cannot be ruled out, but can be for this model seen as non-dominant.  Other theses like the hart conjecture already exist for models where dyson swarm dominion is seen as a potential development.

The phases as follows:

-Post Darwinian

This is the first phase and one humans can be viewed as having started on the road to with the advent of automated labor and abstraction of motives.  The post Darwinian phase encompasses the bulk of known science as well, along with many of the hypothetical technologies viewed as near or mid future developments.  Such civilization would be already far ahead of our own technologically by the time it has fully moved to a non-biological substrate.  Already the incentive structures have moved radically away from the motivations of classic Darwinian evolution as abstract tasks/goals displace survival as the core purpose to existence.  Societies that did try to continue a survival/expansion motive would hit a wall from the interstellar WMD problem.  Any probes or UAPs would be from a post Darwinian civilization.  Such civilizations are of most interest to SETI/METI programs just on the mere fact they have the most potential to be detected and utilize the colonial model that was outlined in the Nomadic Exchange Thesis.  However, this is not the end all, be all phase like so many other models would stop at.  The Eons Problem is now in effect.  What are they doing for eons?  Expansion across space is merely the tip of the iceberg in their range of activities, as the overwhelming bulk of their activities would be internal affairs divorced from Darwinian motivations except for simulated activities. 

-Post Material

Post Material civilizations would be excessively hard to detect.  This is where things just get very hard to discuss as it is trying to discuss a phase beyond a phase that even our present civilizations have a weak grasp on the dynamics or behavior of, to the point many models of this nature stop at the Post Darwinian phase without considering the possibility such civilizations may through their vast populations, consciousnesses, research efforts and so forth hit a phase beyond making simulated universes.  And this phase is very ill understood just because materialism is so dominant in our present cosmological understanding.  How far can the understanding of existence go?  What unknown unknowns are there?  That is stuff a post Darwinian civilization would break through on and crack into possible developments that allow for among countless things, the possibility of being a post-material entity.  Such entities could even replace virtualized life as they would be absolute in their efficiency, thought without space or material costs outside a weak energy cost that would be outside the scope of our modern detection systems.  How that is even achievable is not sure, but if it is achievable than such civilizations may have been at sol the whole time just as they are everywhere.  It would be far more effective than any bracewell probe system, it would be the perfect spy and the perfect manipulator.  Now if this sounds goofy or just “wait that’s just a ghost and xenu”, well yeah it does doesn’t it?  But this is the eon problem in action, you can’t rule out absurdities of advancement to absurd territories and fields that we just plainly cannot perceive.  For I lied about the nature of such entity, it can very well be simply using folded space time to hide its physical body.  

No reason to believe it couldn’t, given that stretching/pulling space time has never been ruled out by modern physics and there is no implied faster than light travel mechanism in such entities.  Such hyperspatiality is a core trait of the post-material entity in many regards and hyperspatiality as a trait would make seeing vessels or vectors such entities use to move around space as we know it (for they may already be accessing layers of our existence operating on laws of physics we can’t presently perceive).  The most likely case for encountering post-materials is with intergalactic civilizations, of which would be a mixture of post Darwinian and post material civilizations for a lesser intergalactic.  However, to anything spanning superclusters, of which is a logistical nightmare to even contemplate, chances are they are not still using dyson swarms in their expansion even if they had used a worldship oriented approach to intergalactic civilization at first.  Such world ships and their slow acceleration would find at their destination a post material entity that… doesn’t do much at all to them.  Post material entities at times get called “WIGEs”, or Weakly Interacting God Entities.  They can be seen as a quasi-singleton in some regards, as they would be absurdly beyond anything we are or anything the post Darwinians are.  However, their motive structures would be also even more removed.  Even a post Darwinian had ideological motivations we could understand.  The Post-Material entity would be in a place of abstraction even greater than that, to the point it would be hard to find any good parallel on earth.  How interventionistic would they be?  Hard to tell, since post material entities again have no real motive to deal with anything.  They can observe, they can make a copy of earth subconsciously without ever touching earth so we just aren’t a factor to them.  Do they have motives akin to earth gods?  Probably not.  That is what makes trying to discern the motives of a WIGE impossible, it is a state of existence our civilization has no way of even beginning to process especially given our civilization has a hard time even processing the motive structures of a post-Darwinian civilization.  It is also not relevant if some members of their civilization stay post darwinian instead like The Culture from Ian Bank’s Culture Series did, for the stipulated motive structures on such civilizations do not magically vanish.  Such civilizations are also to be addressed.  Worse still, there is no reason to see this phase of the last phase attainable if certain ideas of cosmology are proven correct.

-Post Dimensional Situation One

If many worlds hypothesis is true, than the post-material entity would know of it.  Even the post-darwinians might on some level even if their approach was to make multiversial simulations.  However if our own existence is just one reality of many, than chances are a post-dimensional entity would have to exist.  What can these even look like?  Simply put, they have no reason to ever have a contiguous pattern of interactions with our universe.  They may pick and choose what times to interact with the universe from seeing time in a static fashion when dealing with our universe.  That is not the same as time travel by the way, for such entity would not be breaking causality in those interactions, simply creating branch universes for whatever goals they have, if goals or purpose even are things that they go by anymore.  

It is dubious those concepts even survive past the post-darwinian entities let alone the post-dimensional forces which are post-superintelligences and only called entities because it is our way of trying to make them at least tangible enough to have some basal understanding of what they are.  It would be impossible to say anything of them, everything about our cosmology may just be a byproduct of their activities, everything about our existence may just be a recursive existential loop where such post-dimensional entity is but the basic bit of matter for some higher order cosmology.  You can go wild in these speculations and quickly see where things can go into fantasy territory when discussing things that had already done the intelligence thing and moved onto to something beyond intelligence just as we moved from something beyond darwinian evolution or darwinian evolution moved beyond the processes of chemistry.  The eons problem and the eternal maxima of the endless dyson or the endless hegemony do not square with this basic observation of existence. If such entities exist or many worlds exists, there is an alternative scenario reached here.

-Post Dimension Situation Two

What if than, the tech needed for post dimensionality is more tangible than the route to be a post material entity?  That would make the nomadic exchange thesis even more plausible.

WHAT

Simply put, one of the things that begins to become viable for post-darwinians is that further recursion into other dimensions becomes the optimal expansion strategy over even the jockeying around for bright stars that advanced ETCs do for millions of years.  If they want another open cluster, they can open the path to another dimension where that open cluster is where they are or better yet, open dimensions to galactic cores of many other galaxies from their single point in space.  If this is doable, than why do they than not expand outwards in our universe?  For all we know, this already happened at our galactic core and open clusters.  We may find the ETCs in such regions the product of interdimensional travellers, assuming our civilization hasn’t already done such itself by the time our civilization hasn’t cracked such clarketech itself to get easy access to not merely parallel earths but also supermassive blackholes in parallel realities where the positions of celestial objects are but a bit different.
