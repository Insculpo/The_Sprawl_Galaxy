5 reasons

-Ecumenical galactic ecology projects

The galactic ecology initiatives of the ecumenical sought preservation of life in the biospheres that existed and so non-interference was the norm. Client species only were possible if they already industrialized, something humans never managed around 7000 BC. The scan sweeps were mostly undetected by ancient humans, but not entirely. Sightings of strange lights were something the magnon speaks of. However the small size of tribes and weakness of oral information and the rarity of such sightings along with simply not being able to even tell they what they were. Similarly it was just hard to discern natural and unnatural supernova as part of the way such devices worked was to cause a core collapse with strangelet saturation.

-Instrumental clarity

Telescopic Instruments In the 21st century were ascending to being able to detect the sprawl, but due to not knowing where or how to look for the ecumenical it was hard to see. Anomalous pulsar clusters would be detected by the 2030's but it would take the Crab Nebula revelation to really hammer home that there was a fallen galactic civilization. The nature of which unknown.

-Percolation

The Ecumenical was very percolative in colonization patterns, they were selective in where they sent colony seeds in nodal networked clusters of ecumenical systems linked by wormholes.

-Hyperspatial existence

A lot of later ecumenical society had their civilization built into hyperspatial node networks that layered atop of the ecumenical clusters. The hyperspatial realms had been lost to space-time as of now. And with it tons of tech, logistics and so on. The folding ones are believed to be the only ones to be able to access one of these realms and even there, it is dangerous.

-Inwards Shift

The sprawl after the rupture shifted inwards, which meant they didn't do much with the systems they used to watch guard. The rupture harmed some star systems but many were kept safe by archivers that didn't want to lose the data, but the archivers like the sprawl lost interest in the galactic consolidation projects. The sprawl was an endless writhing conflict of identities and remnant groups and the archivers just wanted to horde data in silence, for the sake of archiving galactic knowledge as the highest cause. None of these societies were interested in contacting upstarts or bringing them into the ecumenical orders. If anything, the intent would be that those upstarts would come to them and they would be dealt with as they come. That is how confident even the sprawl populations are about their advantages over more primitive upstart interstellar societies
