Core mechanics:

-Arcadey space travel

-Poweruo based progression mixed with space combat. Basically, needing certain power ups to open more of the universe

-There aren't many actual worlds to explore, instead you can access individual worlds or worlds /w orbital objects like moons and artificial structures. Procedural gen exploration isn't a priority here.

-Avatar switching is the core mechanic, with the ability to get more entities to transfer into.

Story:

-You are a member of the stellar abyss, sent on a long mission to the depths of the universe to uncover the truth behind the Folding Ones who have been harassing the local detachment.

-As a member of the imperium, you are a post biological Human mind that can transfer their consciousness to various avatars and have multiple parallel experiences. Said avatars must be synced or they will shut down.

-Start of game initiates you, with memories of a rather utopian life on some utopian future world. It is destroyed, with human minds taking refugee as implants to AIs as a dead hand contingency...

-Fast forward centuries into the future, the Silent Pact has managed to become a powerful civilization that pulls the strings among a vast array of galactic politics... Workong towards the oblivion of those who killed them.

-You start off as a member scouting force that gets attacked by the Urzine due to your intrusion, you are the only survivor strewn about hostile alien territory and with damage done to tons of data due to a forcible transfer to a small ship being done. You than must ESCAPE with the small ship, other ships get destroyed but you narrowly get out of there and warp to a recall point to find two other survivors who commit suicide and encourage you to do the same to not compromise the blink drives.

-If you refuse to, the first ship comma negotiation begins. Succeed in convincing them to work with you to go down the NEVER RETREAT route. Fail and it's the SURVIVAL ADMIST THE ABYSS route

-The coordinates to a location is attained from them that takes the player to a trading outpost where you meat the Fosskemians. Whatever occurs here varies- if with the two others they merge with your ship and expand your dialog options. They have the other two ships destroyed out of protocol but will stick with you instead.

NEVER RETREAT

-The two other survivors are Mauve and Titus. They are characterized by being as it turns out, rather polar opposites in mentality. Titus is someone who is very material oriented and takes control of your combat drones while at times getting artifacts from areas you go to you didn't on his own separate excursions.

-Mauve meanwhile does a lot more scanning and translating work, making communication and exploration much easier. Mauve tends to prefer staying in the ship, to her detriment in some degrees but does come out when you are meeting aliens or otherwise.

-The two have a professional veneer but it cracks, it already is weakened by the trauma of losing two dozen other personalities in the ambush.

-Gameplay wise they make things really different.

SURVIVAL AMIDST THE ABYSS

-This route is the hard route.

-You have a harder time understanding aliens and resource acquiring is more tedium

ï¿¼

Game world map, the "level select" screen. Longer distances risk interception at lost worlds, some places have radius around them where interceptions are more frequent. Yes, you see your ship travel. Wormholes don't have these risks, but may take you to a region you don't have the coordinates for.

Warp coordinates as a system

-Player has a list of warp coords

-The map checks the player of their warp coords

-Reveals places w/ feedback on map whenever the player finds a new plac
