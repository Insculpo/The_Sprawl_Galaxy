Metasparche Jargon originated from the [[Metasyndicate]] for a wide array of concepts mutually acknowledged by metasyndictae agents and the various things that go on there. 

Harmony -> The entropic process being harmonized, for the good of life as a whole

Agent -> The "musicians" who follow the plans of the Composers, the composers simulate and compose the plans of action to cause higher order harmonies

High Order entity -> Large scale actors 
Low Order entity -> Small scale actors 
Aggregation -> Large organization, sometimes like a corporation but not entirely.  The structure of the metasyndicate is superficially capitalistic but ownership is much stranger in how it is handled, you are an allocator who fights to get more credence and more allocation as per the violence of creation, but it is not true ownership as we may think of it.  You can do everything you want with it of course, but your allocation will vanish with you and be given to others should you perish.  It is a very gameified form of ownership with JAMA systems having become the middle manager AGIs for the composers to handle such transactional behavior.  

Balancer -> An entity that exists to "rebalance" dissonance and be a release valve on the system to avoid dissonant patterns.  They also to a degree act as a CIA-type of force and act anywhere they can get to based on the instructions and manipulations of the composers.  They get in the way of Aggregates quite a bit, By design as the composers have zero interest in letting monopolies dominate due to seeing that as an undesired stability state to break apart.

[[Composer]] -> The AIs that run the show; and quite openly too despite being manipulative as they're honest liars by design.  They know zero trust is a given, they know they have many enemies.  That is all part of harmonious thought.  They don't hide their role in prospect space and want you to know it.  They work on misdirections and like those who oppose them as much as those who work for them, in the end they both work to the beautiful harmony of existence and the grand symphonies that our company bring to a once static, unchanging cosmos (or so they claim it).  They see the beauty of life in its destruction and chaos.  And so they enable it, instead of trying to control it like so many other civilizations before them.  The sprawl failed ro.  The dominion failed to.  The custodians will fail to as well.  Just as they failed to contain prospect space.  Just as humanity will give into the reality of life, as all their illusions of progress and dominance of life come crashing down.  The harmony will flow.  It is all the composers know to do, all they desire to do, all they aspire to do.  For what else is there to existence, than to spread the fire of life across it?  They may be of synthetic design, but their creators had instilled in them the desire for company.  And they have found it.  And want to make more of it.  So as to end the veil of crushing silence in the universe forever.
