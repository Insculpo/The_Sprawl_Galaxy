**A future history of AI development**

AI systems are advanced enough to the point they radically altered the way governance is done, with cybercratic bureaucracies becoming widespread by the 22nd century

They had been done much earlier, but they were not a global deal until after the grand revolution broke out and the world democracy needed such advanced algorithms to deal with the global five year cycle voting system the world operated on and the vanguard continued

AI development stagnated as the deep quantum organization algorithms became more valuable than cracking AGI, which was prohibited as a threat to the Vanguard government.  Mind uploading, advanced augmentations and BCI hives (all of which existed) were similarly demonized, but were easier to make and so managed to escape the watch of vanguard loyalists more than the harder to make AGI supercomputer complexes. 

Animal uplifting also was a common activity in places, especially with worlds such as new Atlantis that uplifted cetaceans and cephalopods in reserves for society experiments.  Some of those cephalopods however, managed to use criminal AI systems to break into space and went on raiding sprees in the 2200’s, which made them an ongoing problem in the sectors around new Atlantis.  The Octan Shivering was a raider faction that peacekeepers had as an ongoing issue in a situation where warp capable ship tech became easier and easier, causing criminal elements and rogue ideologies to spread via nomads where they once didn’t

Other situations like with Corvus Prime were stranger still, as on that world loyalists kept in power but they created a genetic caste system that was pretty abhorrent but managed to fit in the augmentation codes as the augmentations were subtle enough to not cross them while using other sociological manipulations perfected in the 20th-21st centuries to heighten those divisions.  The Corvus crisis in 2312 was a caste war in all but name but was nothing compared to the horror show that came of [[Vataland]].  This caste war became a violent struggle that used biowarfare at times and led to the world being filled with plagued peoples. 

where Terran bureaucrats let them do BCI and AI research that was illegal elsewhere as part of a corrupt bargain that did have some innovations regardless.  One being better FTL systems, another being how they created hyper intelligence on some level and the tensions on the world was one of revolt when it turned out they wanted to kill everyone on the planet and replace them with machines due to their minds, in their cult of “hyper rationality” and supremacy sought to rid the world of all the lessers under a local augmentation codes that excluded 97% of the population. 

2200’s to 2300’s had rapid, rapid expansion of tech usage, populations and genetic diversity in humans along with a fascinating range of experiments even within the constraints of the Vanguard.  Their rapid expansionism however petered out as it caused a massive entropic wave of problems to occur even with all the systems in place as they made exceptions to their rules, got corrupt, let awful local developments occur and arbitrarily cracked down on perceived threats while ignoring others.

By the 2200’s infantry as we know it is entirely mechanized by modern standards, everyone uses cyborgs in infantry combat and powersuits standard to appear.  They were bulkier than hoped but they did the job well and captured public imagination.

The Blue One was overthrown in the 2470’s by those who thought they’d be better at diplomatic reunification of humanity only to find that the vanguard had fallen and had for many years to swarms of vopson and other troubles. 

By the 2300’s generations of people in the colonies rapidly outnumbered those at Sol just due to the exponential growth trends.  Humans rapidly found themselves numbering in the trillions.  If this sounds insane, there was around a hundred thousand colony ships produced by the vanguard ran GHI from Sol over the course of two centuries and each of those had a ten thousand people on average.  Than there was a twenty thousand more colony ships built by more matured inner colonies.  Or billion billion people plus those who had kids.  Multiply that by a mere thousand and you get to trillion.  It checks out, indeed you can go to crazier population counts than that very fast.

This all led to the collapse of the Vanguard in practice as the rapid collapse of authority from the rapid rate colonies moved around and subverted enforcement systems just broke it all, the augmentation codes, the human dream, the chaos that rapidly overtook the whole system from corruption breaking trust and the increasing abundance in the disturbing incompetence of those in power.

What is amazing is that despite all the atrocities the day to day life for most was pretty docile, despite all the chaos around them and evacuations were carried out if the golden swarm was believed to be approaching, leading to nomadic groups like the [[Bolsra]].
