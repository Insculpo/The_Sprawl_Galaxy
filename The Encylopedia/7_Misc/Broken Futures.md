The future is broken

The future humanity

-Is a society of machine, cyborg people

-They are advanced but out of a societal breaking from the tyranny of the vanguard, the instability it caused... the sudden chaos of the collapse and the faction conflicts that followed the overthrow of the Blue One on earth.

-The rival consolidated factions are in a tense alliance due to the outside danger of the prospect spacers. But it is tenuous and prospect spacers have managed to foment divisions while gaining human converts...

-Most humans are stratified between more organic/partial cyborg people with baseline augments and more higher ranking full body cyborgs, with virtual minded people a force and clade of their own.

-Humans have built elaborate projects on the tense peace, with large powerful unions and organizations within the plexus itself causing lots of regional drama that threatens to bubble up further.

-[[The Sprawl]] also has remained a contention, the sprawl cluster at the Crab Nebula had a short cut to it found in the lost world of [[Gilizet]].

-The Midnight War was 50 years ago but its legacy remains, as a potent conflict which many living people recall and reference for lots of combat in the post-plexus era.

-Prospect Spacer relations are strange and convoluted by how humans are in a position almost analogous to East Asia and Europe. Prospect Spacers tech edges are known, but limited by factors like sprawl deterrence and humans having copied some prospect spacer technologies (notable antimatter production and containment methods along with the disassembly pods) with help from prospect space immigrants and a composer who let humans have that tech to make them equals- much to the chagrin of dozinists and antidozinists seeking clients

-There are other species but humans are the clear dominant species. The aliens often take very different niche spaces from humans like deep tunnel networks or dwelling beneath the ice shell. They are cybernetic as well as a product of most industry by humans pushing tech that direction- a similar phenomena to the biosynthetic tech hegemony of prospect space but with silicon-photonic electronics.

Prospect Spacers

-Abominations. Their civilization has become an entropy accelerationist hive of void ecologies

-Dozinists, Biomorphias and Harmonists fluctuate across numerous societies assimilated into their system

-Dominant forces include composers, the cancer and the ikeitans

-Their internal conflicts are endless skirmishing and humans are seen as potential clients... but also something else due to being another interstellar civilization so close to their own. Which has concerned some in prospect space but the composer AKKA had other plans for the humans.

-Extremely advanced biosynthetic technology. Sound and matter interwoven. Capable of temporary dematerialization and fluidic states for high inertia survival.

-Manu species clearly delineated, it is a multispecies civ operating under a different ethical axis.

-Computing paradigm is not clear

Sprawl

-Most ancient of the civilizations, no one really gets their deal.

-Found in matrioshka world and other strange structures

-Just an ancient civilization spread about the galaxy, they are mostly an enigma.

-Disconnected atrophy, there used to be endless wormhole networks and hyperspace realms.

-They seem to be extremely, extremely advanced with energy to mass conversion a regular feature of their civilization and black hole/singularity based technology having also been widespread along with even dark matter manipulation.

-Their minds are incoherent, they exist totally detached from reality and altered their own memories constantly. They are immortal and have shifted identities and being over the millennia. Despite this one has identified a several of these forms including the "diovierme" and "operiunn" forms. How these come and go seem to be from a weird sense of postidentity formulation. They are congregational beings, phantom beings wandering an eternal galactic graveyard.

Harlapan/Architect

-The distant beings of intelligent programmable matter

-Responsible for the [[Glinnvyr]] and Aveterriat.

-Were connected to the sprawl in some way once, distant history.

-More advanced than the prospect/civic societies but less advanced than the sprawl

-Came from derelict evolution. Archivers seem to have let them do this, one of the tension sources they had with the sprawl who did go out of their way to destroy other instances of this occurring only for the rupture to stop them from getting every single one in the chaos of the annihilating.

-Glinnvyr and Aveterriat have a weird connection to them from how their activities in ancient times influenced them to develop civilizations. No such influence has been found in our region of the galaxy.

-They are far off, so don't really matter much outside the interloping entities that sometimes arrive. Most notorious being the custodians.

No real use for [[Phidians]] or Tikali. Ikirmites and Stevik along with the enigmatic [[Stargi]] are enough.

Each of these civilizations are meant to be eldritch in their own way, alarmingly so

Thematic motifs

[[Human]]/civic- A machine civilization where humans have become obsolete, with humans having to become a new species just to stay relevant with post human existence being the byproduct of the vanguard's demise. It is still hopeful, in suggesting humans will technologically evolve and adapt. The mechanical life is one that can be unbearable regardless. The machine and spirit are one in the same. Any measure to avoid the worse fate of being subsumed by prospect pace is acceptable to most humans. Becoming full body cyborg shells is not for the super humanity of it- it is a protective measure against the daunting forces of a galaxy where countless acts of mass death is possible at any moment. Humans are a cold, calculating species in the future. Some romanticism exists, but it is very fixated on ideological romanticism. The family unit has gone extinct centuries ago, there is in its place atomized people who have to come together.

[[Prospect Space]]- They are monsters that mask as a civilization. Their empires are "leviathan", their theological premise is to create a super organism. Their harmony is entropy acceleration to that end goal. The whole ebb, flow and structure of their civilization is a chaotic tempest of rival factions who converge to the operant goal of ASI known as Composers (and other forces at play, [[Ikeitans]] and the biomorphia) with incomprehensible thought and the actual terminal goal lost to time. One can only be for the ride. A fallen warrior society, the fosskemians in their mass delusions- the whandl Vulcanites laboring. All connected in chaos. Their sense of identity is one of PIT gone mad. Despite having some feats greater than humans, the humans managed to catch up in hard fields. Only enough to deter, and slowed down not long after. Sprawl tech was no human monopoly.

Architect - The harlapa architects did a maneuver on a huge scale to accelerate the advancement of various sapients. The Glinnvyr were the greatest benefactor. The Adchitects represent a sort of utopian society, they are prospering and are the current galactic hegemony on without the sprawl unified and the other civ clusters being many millennia away in distance and quite behind technologically. Their spread out societies represent the coldness of existence, they are individualists and confederations are the norm. Even the ascension war represents utopian conceits lost to the paranoid. The custodians are the worst authority imaginable, but they too represent the utopian and heavily romantic mindset contained without. The horrific reality of the custodians continues to be what destroyed the glory of the architect. These are beings who broke reality itself and are but the detritus of something even more cosmically ancient...

The Sprawl - Beings without identity, the endless cities, eternities lost. They are so far advanced it can cause the mind to retreat. And they aren't extinct either, the denizens remain alive and well. One would be best to evade them. The few who speak only will dictate terms to you. The rest see you in a less fortunate light. The lucky are seen as intruders. The place is an endless tomb inhabited by what few survived building a memorial to the past, and dwelling in agony of the memories they deleted... never knowing who they have forever lost in those foolish attempts to remove trauma from the mass death that had occurred with the rupture. They tried with all their advancements to rewrite the past, to repress the atrocities of it. But that reality they cannot ever fully erase. Only hide from. This led them to a timeless, crystallized existence that has lasted to the present. They are ancient, advanced and so meeting with one often can feel spiritual if. It behind daunting. Those who manage it may find themselves making choices on behalf of their whole civilization.... how long as their stasis being going? Hard to truly say, dating programmable matter based metamaterials is notoriously impossible by design. The Crab Nebula's dating points to a point in 6500 BC when the ancient galactic order known as the ecumenical collapsed in [[The Rupture]]. Nearly ten millennia. By comparison none of the other civilizations have been around that long. The interstellar societies at play... just the critters who run amok the post nuclear ruins. The sprawl seemingly regards their actions as civilizations of the planetary beings they had once studied retuning to them.

The time mapping

[[[Harlapa]] - Unknown (Architects are 4-7 millennia)

[Sprawl - 50-70 millennia

[Prospect Space - 2.6 millennia

[Civic - 7.5 centuries

---------------------------------

**The Rise of the Plexus**

The rise of the plexus was marked in the chaos of factional conflict which erupted after the downfall of the Vanguard. The tech for mind uploading and AGI had existed for some time but the rapid expansion of its application happened with the factional conflicts as the desire for strategic advantage grew. In this came virtual apparatuses that were initially a part of the factions, they were nationalist in structure. However this would not last as the virtuals started to spread to other networks and systems, at first it was a subterfuge/subversion game competing virtuals engaged in- but than a misaligned diplomacy began to happen behind the scenes of large conflicts like the Klus Invasion of Sol or the Regnant-Consortium wars. The Reginald revolution against the Regnant in the wake of those wars led to the birth of what became the Greater Systems Assembly, the nepotistic aristocracy replaced by a trilateral cyborg hierarchy with populist characteristics. Another war of unification happened under their leadership, bolstered by the Consortium unraveling from guild-caste conflict and the Eridanis, along with the [[Virtue Coalition]]'s rise in sectors in the other side of human dominated space. Eventually the Virtue Coalition, made of those who uploaded due to the collective trauma of the Golden Swarm of which the Greater Systems Assembly only sent some support in handling would come to deadlocked conflict against the Greater Systems Assembly. It was in this consolidating environment the Plexus formulated more rapidly due to the destruction of server complexes from these wars causing need for a unified front separate of the cyborg warlords that seemingly dominated humanity. The Plexus in 2630 became a formal entity that both the Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition recognized, indeed this is why 2630 is regarded as the start of the current Plexus era. The chaos of the 2500's had come to a close. But there was still other societies out there including the Estate and the Solar Union, along with the ticking time bomb that would be the alien forces in the galaxy. Be it the obvious danger of alien imperialists posed by Prospect Space or the eldritch forces at play elsewhere. The Plexus arose in part to be a force which could organize against these dangers. And in part as the neutral virtual space between the exceedingly tense Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition whose deep rift simply wouldn't mend. The Greater Systems Assembly and Virtue Coalition sought to reunify humanity under their way of existence, and see the other power as the only thing in the way of that.

If it starts in 2700 or so the Estate still would be around.
