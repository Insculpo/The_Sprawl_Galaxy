W: Blistering bastard where am I?
T: I manifested you to talk with me
W: Disgust!  Liduskitter only.
T: I want you to play a game with me
W: Quadscope?  Hibberflanking?  Sadalian Daring?
T: No, a game called 20 questions
W: Oh.  One of these kinds of studies.
T: Yeah well
W: Alright, so you see 
T: What do Whandl eat?
W: We tend to live on stringed beaker feed, sometimes preferring to crack sessile borks to get extra proteins in. 
T: What do you do?
W: Computer engineer, we have geothermal crystalline computer systems that developed with introspection in the quantum state computation of the old synthetics to create the modern paradigm prospect space runs on.  Fosskemians stereotypically make software and robots, we stereotypically make the hardware and power systems that enable them.   Tech is complicated but if you want species reductionism, there you have it.
T: What is daily life like?
W: Your questions are uninteresting and boring.  Anyways, it is like any operation.  We dolly out the allocated work expected under a system of cycling quotas so every whandl can shift hats and not feel stuck overspecializing.  
T: That concerns you?
W: Absolutely!  Doing the same thing is terrible, all the time especially.
T: And this is an ongoing issue?
W: We cannot afford overspecializing, should the arms be cut for the best reasons, we want to have other labor to send those lucky ones immediately.  
T: What do you mean “best reasons”?
W: Someone is ignorant of Whandl reproduction.  The male Whandl cuts their limbs, these limbs fertilize egg purses inlaid by the female.  Our kind consider this process incredibly romantic.
T: Yeah well it just reminds me of botflies so let’s not dwell on it
W: [[Human]] pregnancy is far more disgusting
T: Let’s not get into this kind of argument
W: You are the one comparing us to lower order organisms just because we don’t bloat like a novamycelia victim when gestating children 
T: Whatever
W: Besides your myopic outlook, yes we care for our amputated males.  They grow wiser with age, so their value persists just as you care for your elders.  Societies that would just toss their minds to the wayside, those were ceremonially defeated time and time again.  They tossed those who knew the game best in the delusion they were cutting unneeded chitin from the aggregate.  Instead they cut off their head.
T:  Is your society a patriarchal one?
W: Your terms do not apply.  One biological sex being "dominant" is just not how we do things.  We have our gender roles but do not conflate that with a dualistic dominance/submission of biological sex like the Fosskemians, Humans and such.  The leading class isn't gendered in that way as the male wise ones and female commandos are in a locked codependency.  
T: Shouldn't the advent of prospect space biotech have destroyed that dynamic?
W: As your kind should know well, post-biological beings cleavage between the enhancers, purists and the deviants.  Your kind has societies that entrenched their patriarchal constructs in a range of ways despite artificial wombs and cybernetics in theory ending it.  There are indeed augmented whandl who regenerate their limbs.  Others gave themselves more limbs.  In all this you had female whandl who enhanced strength.  Instead of the grand contract dying, it revised itself to fit the paradigm.  We had a population explosion thanks to the deal the [[Utanguis]] made with us and the use of their biotechnology in exchange for converting to [[Dozinism]].
T: Doesn't that go against your other values?
W: Dozinism is a fluid faith, it works on a scale broad enough it had no real contradiction to the grand contract or the chthonic world god.  Our kind benefitted more from it than those who resisted it.  
T: You gave up your freedom
W: Freedom?  What freedom did we give up?  We were given space travel, infinite limb regeneration and the symbiotic biotech that the Utanguis bleed by habit.  
T: I see
