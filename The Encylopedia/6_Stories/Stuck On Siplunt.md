You know, they don't prepare you for these things.

At all.

The colony on [[Siplunt]] had been cut off by some squabble many light years away, interstellar travel had been limited heavily and now we are off on our own fending for ourselves.  

Our company on this low gravity world is a mess.  Jumping bladders all over the damned place.  How nature even let such blubbery, stinky and parasitic vermin get all over this world is beyond me.  The design is just too damn stupid.  Gas propelled jumping and bouncing around, it's absurd.  They should be breaking their little leg nipples constantly, but they don't.  Somehow those rubbery hides manage to instead bounce across the clay filled basins to wherever they think food is.

Naturally they've been attracted to our food.  How the hell that makes sense I don't know, maybe they just like the feel of extracting fluids from it even if it's not nutritious for them at all.  Nothing on this planet is nutritious for anyone, it just sits in your bowels instead.  Some here got Terrible stomach aches from trying to grill fork trees.  So we are stuck trying to keep the potato farms and meat vats going even with the pestilence that are the jumping bladders stinking up the place.  They keep trying to suck potatos or hop into the meat vats.  

Other critters in the world are less frustrating, namely the hover birds who seem related to the gas bladders but are more like really big humming birds- like. A meter wide wingspan as they go around sucking fork tree fluids.

So much sucking.  We have to make do with this, sadly.  We have no determinate type of when to expect any way on or off this planet.  Distant wars mean lots of time worrying if our planet is blown us.

So we are doomed either way.
