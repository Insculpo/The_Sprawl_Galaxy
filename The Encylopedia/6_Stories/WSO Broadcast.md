Jana Ip271: "You are Giparnian?"

Tormosa: "Yeah, hatched in District Jipulo and raised by Jibarian Mercs"

IP271: "Jipulo? A nest district fosskemian in dominant population."

Tormosa: "Yeah I get that but it's like we have [[Vopson]] nests and even some [[Yalilu]] hatcheries so it's not a total monocult."

Ip271: "I know an administrator there, Ik56 I believe. We were generated in the same factory but are still of different branches. I had the directive of interviewing as my assigned purpose and have not deviated despite my other 270 iterations. All are like me, all follow the purpose of interviewing."

Tormosa: "Stuck to a purpose like that, painful existence what species would do this?"

Ip271: "Your species made us"

Tormosa: "Your welcome?"

Ip271: "We [[Jama]] do as we do, pain receptors on or off. However the goal of this broadcast has been returned to seeing an argument play out for the entertainment of our loyal WSO clients."

Tormosa: "Arguing is an art form! We will judge the grandiosity of this argument on the Fumunus scale of Dramatics. Type-$4 is my ideal, Type-@17 is Ippy's!"

Ip271: "Do not state Jama names in possessive form. It is denigrating."

Tormosa: "You have a petabyte of interspecies breeding memetics in your storage and care how denigrated you are?"

Ip271:"That kind of data is common in [[Prospect Space]]. Explore outside your nest more."

Tormosa: "For an automata your software is fragile, upgrade yourself"

Ip271: "You are not clever."

Tormosa: "You will never be a real interviewer"

Ip271: "I always have been an interviewer"

Tormosa: "Either way when is the actual argument starting they came here for Sansana and [[Ajenul]], not us!"

Ip271: "Sansana has arrived but Ajenul still is arguing with our staff about the composers again."

Tormosa: "Ajenul, if you have any attention allocated to your WSO node tune in now! You have an auditor to argue with!"

Ajenul: "[[Ikka]]'s fuckslaves can it, it's time for the greater tribulation!"

[[Sansana the Auditor]] : "An [[Utanguis]] terrorist is who I argue with? Who made this bullshit operation?"

Ip271: "With both you having converged to our stream we now open the question- Which species made [[Prospect Space]]?"

Sansana: "We aren't history analysists!"

Ajenul: "The Utanguis, Prospect Space began with the Utanguis and anyone who paid for half an attention would know such. Our kind inspired the Prospector AIs to go beyond being wanderers of the abyss and the Fosskemians spent over a thousand years being extinct while we built a vast empire that shaped Prospect Space to what it is today!"

Sansana: "The Utanguis were and always were more pets than proactive agents. Pets with the caretakers, pets with the dominion and their wannabe god emperor and one day the pets of the ikeitans."

Ajenul: "The Prospectors, like everything [[Fosskemian]], annihilated themselves. We started civilization over and through cosmic gardens grew the ecologies modern civilization sprouted from after the custodian interlopers tried to purge us"

Sansana: "And the Composers, descendants of the AI you mock managed to defeat the custodians while your kind were busier murdering each other and packs getting annihilated from that misguided hubris to fight technologically superior opponents in staged space battles"

Ajenul: "Those Composers intentionally interfered with us!"

Sansana: "Pathological stupidity when the Composers get blamed! Your existence is weak if composers somehow can mutilate it"

Ajenul: "says a member of the species whose history includes nuclear suicide"
