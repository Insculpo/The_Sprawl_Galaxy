The neutral zone, a boneship and a bioelectric agent vessel in the void just deadlocked and now exchanging comms.

[[Teserk]]; You again.
[[Salasana]]; The void screams with the broken one.
Teserk; you carry the remnants of your past lives in tow.  
Salasana; Why is it the symbionts get dramatic about life?  Have you noticed the vilates are like that too?
Teserk; The vilates understand life like we do, as the sum of higher order thought.  Your detached mentality blinded you.  I would fire upon you but you would enjoy it.
Salasana; I didn't know you saw the universe that way, Teserk!
Teserk; In higher order purpose than mere entropy worship?
Salasana; No.  I mean in your banal desire to kill.  You're very attuned to that.  
Teserk; Comedy to hear that from an organism that was of a more predatory role when they still were slaves the order one biology.
Salasana; Bringing up ancient history as if it matters was already inane enough.  We've transcended biology, your kind mastered it.
Teserk; We amplified it.
Salasana; I see but more vectors for entropy.
Teserk; Enough.

At that point a space battle broke out.  Teserk and Sasana's vessels took cross fire shots using energy pulses and tracking disruption mechanics.  So they mostly missed or the interceptors worked.  Not much really managed to break the other.  The tech was too well matched and both of them too skilled.  After a couple "jousts" they gave up and returned to the trash talk.  

Salasana: So much for your superiority
Teserk: I'll continue as needed.
Salasana: Yet you stopped?
Teserk: Wasting my time in you is pointless, I spare my best work for the puppet masters not the flesh puppet you are. 
Salasana: shame!  I had been good at it!
Teserk: I continue my work here.
Salasana: Monitoring Emory space?  You don't use the AIs for that?
Teserk: monitoring you.  Destroying you would be a waste for that reason, much I have learned about you.
Salasana: Not enough seeing how the battle went.
Teserk: You worked for multiple organizations tied to the metasyndicate and have achieved lots of credence.  Shame credence is of no value to us, as the metasyndicate has no credence with us.
Salasana: Our credence has more merit than your merit ever did.  For all the insults you throw at our ways, we know well what we are meant to be and act on it.  Your kind layers itself with delusion.
Teserk: It achieved a higher understanding.  A patsy for the composers lacks any such understanding at all.
Salasana:
