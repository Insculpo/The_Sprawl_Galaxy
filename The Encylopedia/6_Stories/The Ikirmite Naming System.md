Ikirmites are named geographically more than by family or genetics in many cases, especially in the more urbanized regions where an aquapolis like Kiknurs exists.  

However the geographic regions of [[Ikirma]] goes as follows

Vuklanurs (vent cliffs)
Lursokik (seep filled passageway)
Rasikula (no earthly, shifting plains?)
Kularasa (no earthly equvelant, the shifting thermal zones)
Vuklavik (vulcano tube)
Makanurs (trench)
Pasikasa (high field)
Makavik (cavern)

Basically the [[Ikirmite]]'s identity is tied partially to their geographic region.  This is not the only formulation, but it is a common one just as affinity/contrast based naming is.  

All of which had been an ikirmite memory.
