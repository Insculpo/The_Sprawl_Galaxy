Maurice Rosen had a simple ambition in life- reach out into the unknown.  And in the corrupt circumstances she had been mired in... any mission would do.  Even one that was merely to debunk an annoyance but of light.  A bit of light the rabble rousers called a signal 

When Ms. Rosen had gone out to the signal, the mission was simple.  Disprove its existence.  The signal all the same, remained.  And any vision of humanity colonizing the galaxy fell into shambles within seconds.

The distant signal from the exploration vessel just looked like a strange beacon.  The crew had tried to brainstorm what natural reasons could exist for it.  None came up.  The main theory would be that a lost detachment of humanity, maybe from a wormhole CTC or glitch in existence made it to close the loop and needed an observer.  The theory in practice had no backing, less backing than the alien explanation even.  Yet that was what the bureaucrat who came on board to keep a close eye on the mission pushed for.

As the bureaucrat loved to remind her before vanishing into his chambers, "We will colonize the galaxy in a few thousand years.  The universe is eons old.  Aliens cannot exist, Hart proved it to be so."  

The crew as a whole didn't really believe the bureaucrat as the evidence of an ETC to put it mildly, was overwhelming.  But the people who run the Vanguard from [[Earth]] would not have it.  The mission was to issue a statement to disprove its existence more than actual inquiry.

She had seen these kinds of missions from the Vanguard before- such as the deceased crew sent on a centuries long suicide mission to the Crab Nebula.  Only with luck did Rosen end up with a simpler operation.  One so simple a no name bureaucrat from earth with their cushy chambers tagged along!  

The signal had remained distant.  Warp travel was slow.  And on the ship Rosen found her lead explorer role clashing with the bureaucrat and captain on multiple occasions.  The captain didn't do much.  He just liked to play virtual games that simulated his home light years away.  Rosen at one point entered the CIC and asked the captain, "Why are you even here?"

The captain was baffled and simply replied "Because it will improve my ranking to have this low ball of a mission sorted out.  And if... the thing that certainly does not exist due to the Hart conjuncture somehow does... I can't say I am in a place to talk about such hypotheticals."

Rosen curtly replied, "You fear him?"

"Not fear.  To be blunt, it is knowing the actual game being played and playing the game to the best of my ability in the role I have been stationed.  You should know it yourself by now, 'lead explorer'."

"We both know the truth here."

"I know the truth my eyes tell me and the truth I must maintain.  You only can accept the truth of your eyes.  Amazed they let you have that role at all, you must have rich parents."

(Rosen did in fact, have rich parents.)

"That's besides the point!" Rosen protested.  

"What is your point, lead explorer?  You questioned me being here despite your presence being more questionable.  Than want me to take the Hart conjecture in vain in the same spaceship a Terran bureaucrat has used to loudly pleasure himself in for the past week."

The crass statement annoyed Rosen's unwarranted sensibilities so much that she almost said "Oh so you can say that but we cannot say a-"

"Correct.  Don't say that word." The captain interrupted.  She almost said the said. "They forgive a lot, but not that.  It upsets them on a fundamental level."

"Right." Rosen with disdain replied.  "How close are we to the signal anomaly anyways?"

"Less than a day away." The captain stated.  Rosen than just left the room.  Preparations had to begin.

In the exploration module, a drone was set up in the main chamber.  

The technician in the room asked. "Rosen, to review the plan is we just go out there, scan the area and show it is a naturally occurring object of no real significance?"

"That is the plan.  We are here to put a lid on the rumors the less than informed public has been spreading." Rosen clarified. 

"Rumor has it you believe those rumors too." They replied, their androgynous body showing a bit of shakiness in saying that to the lead explorer's face.   

"I only ever thought it a possibility.  An unlikely one because of the hart conjecture, however."

"We'll go with that." The explorer replied.

And with that, the mission moved forward.

The Signal

The bureaucrat had walked out of their chamber, seemingly addled on a synthetic drug.  Their eyes were clearly pink, their breathe smelled like chlorine and his intonation was a skittish mess.  Still, he managed to keep enough of a straight face to tell the crew of the exploration vessel, "A remarkable day!  No... not a day we are... yeah space.  And the signal is here.  We have made it to... a so... called signal.  It's not aliens.  Clear?  Good, now leave me alone... get the garbage... cleaned up." 

The bureaucrat proceeded to have a a coughing fit for thirty seconds straight.  Just constant coughing, with some foam coming from his mouth.  He eventually managed to regain his footing and returned back to his chambers. The crew continued their operations like nothing had happened.

"He overdosed.  Damn it, just damn it, don't die in the ship I don't need the Liberated Light Exploration frigate permanently tarnished!" The captain with frustration said to himself on an open comm by accident.  The captain realized it was an open comm and proceeded to announce, "We have approached the signal and now Rosen and her team will begin the operation.  We expect it will take her team some time as while we are in the the survey drone still must do its job."

Rosen had been happy, "We made it!" She couldn't help but loudly state.  The technician's reservations about the mission remained.  

"I don't get why the drone was even needed if it was meant to forge data anyways" the technician asked Rosen, dampening her mood.  Rosen responded, "To make it more authentic looking.  The mission itself could have been in theory forged but we have names to make for ourselves.  I want to be an explorer, captain whatever his name is wants to have a fancier rank and the bureaucrat (whatever his name is)... wanted a vacations. You must be the only honest person on this ship."

The technician just was jarred by the response.  But didn't say anything else as they set the drone out to see the signal in detail.  

The probe slowly would drift ever closer to an ominous prism shaped object.  The Scanners already had confirmed an artificial seeming shape, but many artificial seeming objects exist in nature and so the probe was sent in to confirm how obviously natural the object was.

"Mr Tams, are you serious?" A bureaucrat asked.

"Very much so.  I want a mission to the Crab Nebula.  I have my lead explorer Rufurd on call, the mission is inevitable.  The wealth I have invested into that pulsar is a fortune.  [[Spinoza Whitgel]] back when democracy was being fumbled about didn't invent warp drives just for us to keep to this tiny corner of the galaxy.  I saw we push the tech to the limit.  The most cutting edge warp drives I have pulled all the strings for.  We will do this mission.  And as the lead financier of this administration you're not really in any position to lecture me.  Play along, another mission was lined up with Maurice Rosen and Captain Hubert.  You'll be watching that mission.  Think of it as a vacation."

The bureaucrat nodded and proceeded to stop pestering Mr Tams.  Mr Tams moved to then talk with another member of the terrain council.  The council saw the proposal Mr Tams put forward and it was rubber stamped near immediately.  The president approved of it, and the legislature followed suit.  This result was of no shock to Mr Tams, as The president of Earth Casana had been mostly a door mat.  She just would go with whatever Mr Tams proposed.  Or really any wealthy Terran with a position of power in the Vanguard.  Just as it had been for decades.  There was a couple political factions, elections still occurred and all that but it was mostly for show as calling the vanguard "empire" would be an insult.  A large professional class was catered to, Tams knew that aspect of the game well.  But than there was the lower echelons of human society.  The deluded rabble who believed in many things.  And the alien question was one Tams in secret, couldn't help but contemplate at times.

But such thoughts were dangerous to have, especially on earth in the halls of the Vanguard.  Still, Tams managed to send a mission to the ever so distant Crab Nebula to know for sure.  He framed it as a mission to secure a pulsar in advance and symbolically put an end to the false readings ancient satellites predating the Vanguard had once given out.  Mere revisionism mostly succumbed for that.  But reality was reality, and hard reality demanded a hard disproving.  

Tams looked upon a massive portrait of Spinoza Whitgel.  The founder of the warp travel which mde the Vanguard possible.  And he couldn't help but be impressed at it all.  Shame about the descendants, Tams mused as he called a travel pod to meet with the crew he financed...
