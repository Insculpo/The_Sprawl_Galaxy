T- Talking One
P- Phidian "negotiator"

A: "The Phidian negotiator is here"
T: "Good.  What do they want?"
P: "To discuss a cessation of the prospect space raiding our volumes of the galaxy,  estranging their victims from the consulate and filling them with wretched mentality"
T: "Sudden entry?  You can always take them bac-"
P: "So they may spread their cinderist degeneracy?  We may on the clause you accept our right to euthanize those poor broken souls.  No amount of fixing can work for them."
T: "See, they stay in [[Prospect Space]] due your own policies and we maintain the right to allow phidians to travel.  Your traditions are irrelevant to us.  We have dealt with many sapients trying to use such arguments.  They melt away upon contact with our grand civilization.  Besides, the [[Phidians]] we get are mostly those cinderists you regard as a pestilence anyways, it's a mutual arrangement"
P: "You raid our space, you follow a belief of collective psychopathy.  There is nothing right or correct and we see all the poor beings you have afflicted with that contagious mental illness you arrogantly call harmonious thought."
T: "A phidian that bothers to learn about other species?  How strange."
P: "I was given the misfortune of this task.  The conditioning however was altered to allow for my activities here.  Do not play games with me."
T: "All of existence is a game, you may choose to play the most silent one but we have chosen to play better games"
P: "Your kind are a joke, no wonder they play games so much!  Allowed to exist too long.  The custodians did a poor job."
T: "And you?"
P: "Cease!  We will not disperse information to undeserving cretins like you"
T: "In which case request denied as you don't even want to share data, there is no means to reason with you glorified rocks."
P: "Than expect more violence"
(The Phidian at that point just leaves)
