The recursive sigmund server complex has detected multiple unknown entities. Their signatures are loosely consistent with "custodian" class USOs. Current instrumentation has allowed us to peer into what they are like more than prior attempts had. What we have uncovered about the properties has been elaborated on here with a loose sense of transparency to protect the integrity of the station.  Little did they know the extent to which the [[Custodians]] have observed...

Classification: Custodian Entity TC.281 [sector code, number sighted]

Assessed Status: Patrol

**Known capabilities**

- It has been observed seemingly dematerializing and rematerializing elsewhere in the system.
- It does this cyclically, which led us to flag a patrol status on it
- The Movement appears to be reactionless
- Whatever it is communicating with is not something we are able to access
- The observed Size is estimated to be 270 meters, as a prism shaped object it is 30 meters in depth and 150 meters in width. A 1:5:9 ratio that is somehow critical to the design.
- The surface is extremely blank, it defies any attempt to see what exists on its surface.
- We cannot gleam any details on what modules, hatches or propulsion mechanism it has.
- It is all obscured by an ultra black substance we have no means of penetrating.
- We aren't even sure if this is the actual entity or a projected shadow of it in our plane of existence.

The observed entity and its purpose in this system has led to some to try to abandon the servers, as our worst fears had been confirmed. It is indeed a custodian entity. The capabilities of these entities have been gleamed from the destruction of the Ramos foundation and what prospect spacers had encountered of their invading forces. We cannot be sure this custodian is of the same capabilities or more advanced than what had been encountered in the centuries since.

**Those capabilities include**

- The capability to destabilize entire stars
- The capability to project and distort gravity
- Being able to materialize unknown destructive substances with a what is loosely known as a grid kill mechanism

At this current time the custodian entity TC.281 has continued to make its presence known in the system. It has been patrolling closer to the station. It knows we are watching it. We can't be sure what it knows but we have already on our most encrypted channels sent out a notice to the local colonies to arm the citizen militias in preparation for the worst. We do worry what the custodian will do, it has been utterly silent. An attempt to communicate with it was sent, but it gave no response and instead began to patrol closer to this station. What its intentions are remains unknown. We know a silent pact cult had been in the system, but those are everywhere. Something more had to be here. Perhaps the pact itself? I myself would not entertain the concept. The pact wouldn't compromise an entire data server complex. They had to surely be more careful than that.

[12739 HE 02.05]

Continued observation of the custodian more up close revealed to us very jarring details about the design. It is a shade of violet up close, a vivid and dark shade of it whose iridescent shifter what light passer by it as our station trainer lights on it. The custodian itself began to distort in response. And it finally stated something to us.

What it said had the personnel of the station in panic. I had stayed stoic, as I knew worst came to worst I would simply perish. These aren't sadists like the vopson. They just kill you. Almost a relief in a way, compared to the sickening activities we know other societies engage in to their victims. Mind mutilation, forcing trauma to your mind copies. Time dilating torture. Forced "symbiosis", protracting burning. And even worse. The custodians when they chose to strike just annihilate. That is all they do.

What it stated was blunt.

"You believed us stupid?"

It didn't do much after that, but what was discovered was that no one could leave the station anymore. It had somehow jammed our communication systems and streaming. relay ships from other star systems stopped arriving to the station, relay ships that attempted to leave the system were intercepted. They went dark. It had locked the system down and most certainly wasn't alone.

[12739 HE 02.06]

It has yet to terminate us, we cannot say why. It did give time to mobilize the militias who have been warned of an advanced opponent in the system. Riots on the colony over the lock down have already broken out, the militias and silent cultists have been using this anger for recruitment. The silent cultists seem in particular fired up. The silent pact is here isn't it? We had been told they weren't, but now it all makes sense. They were here to purge the system and wanted to keep silent pact agents from leaving. And silent pact agents could be anyone. So they purge everyone. They are setting up to kill everyone here.

The militias have mobilized around the colony, vessels have been en route to this server complex to add to our defenses but we have no confidence it will be enough. We are rats mobilizing against an exterminator. Best we can do is swarm them.

May humanity prosper.

[12739 HE 02.07]

I have streamed myself to a "safer" location within the system, the custodians seem to be only interested in intercepting attempts at interstellar scale movement. They even let us move our militia vessels, fears are high it's because they know where they are headed and have a trap setup. Why don't they just strike is what baffles me. They have such a massive tech advantage over us and they have a demonstrated desire for belligerence, as it seems. They did their monitoring enough and from what we gleam of their activities, deemed the system infected with silent pact agents. Not telling us was non sense, we found out that aspect of their activities through simple observation of their actions. Still it is a cold scene in the colonies, the impending death caused some to recede into overclocked simulations as a coping mechanism but that only will delay the inevitable for them. When this system vanishes, we will have an incident on our hands. Not to the scale of the foundation massacre but still, another atrocity done by the custodians upon us. And we can't even say why. We didn't understand the scale of silent pact presence in this system. They were there the whole time. And we must suffer for it!

The militias have decided to not reach their destination, for they have shared paranoia we do. We have to behave less predictably, the custodians likely know multiple cases but there is a known limit on their ability to strike from hyperspace. That being their need to predict accurately where to hit something from. So changing alter modifying trajectories regularly is what he have done. It really just delays against them. It is at that point the custodians started to attack.

They wiped out all of recursive sigmund. It was a hyperspace strike, they projected a singularity into the station causing it to implode. The servers and inhabitants were crunched together, pulverized by overbearing forces dragging them to the center. Layer upon layer crushing inwards. The suffering those that did time dilation over clocking must have had I don't even want to contemplate. Only that I mercifully have moved my own presence far away from that station so as to continue these observations. Already I have in one of the moons of the local Jovian world buried archives. If the custodians find them you won't be seeing this.

[12739 HE 02.08]

The militias have managed to open fire on it, they had managed to end up leaving from their dematerialized realm in a region that was anticipated based on prior observation. We cannot say how they made a mistake that basic and inept, we had thought them at the very least with all the capabilities and power issues they demonstrate, wise. We were wrong.

The combined fire of the militias managed to seemingly break through its interception layers, harming the entity. It was as a sight like watching a cascading wave of explosions rupture the void of space, pushing into the custodian. The custodian managed to still destroy hundreds of the militia vessels using proxy strikes, but it wasn't enough. One sees these attacks from afar, it just looks like bursts of light that violently expand out and than quietly fade, over and over again. Wondering constantly when you will be next. The enforcer seemingly was destroyed, the dust had faded. However we know they weren't alone. They rarely are. It took an amassed System wide fleet just to destroy one of these custodians. And they were likely but the drones of their civilization, not the actual military force if they have any. It took hundreds of spaceships and thousands of lives just to destroy one of their automata.

Whatever "victory" was here is a weak, hollow one. Another custodian will arrive to the system shortly.

A team from the combined fleet was sent out to see what remains of the custodian drone could be salvaged, an act of vanity given this one drone's error will be short lived. Whatever can be gleaned between now and the rest of the custodians returning to wipe out the rest of us is crucial.

We had confirmation the Silent Pact is indeed the system. They were here for years and so many of us were out of the loop. Multiple associates I knew turned out to be sleepers of the silent pact. I am not of their number. Their activities they have left us out of knowing, likely fearing our comms too easily compromised by the custodian enforcers. We only hope they are protecting the system and did not just abandon us to them.

The salvaging team has managed to collect a sample of their meta materials. They don't know at all what to make of the substance. It has no real coherent parallel to anything we have encountered before. It doesn't even follow the programmable matter substrates the sprawl is laden with. It is made of a substance totally foreign to anything else we have encountered. This confirms at the very least they are as the theory suggested, of a distant civilization. Consistent with what the records said of their kind. It is one thing to gleam the encyclopedias of Metasyndicate creation, it is another to see it firsthand. That these beings came from such distant stars to control us. The actual substance of the matter, is seemingly built to endure the surface of stars. It could convert itself into a relativistic kill vehicle if it wanted to with ease. The gravity beam it had deployed against Recursive Sigmund was standard fare for these things.

And without much hesitation I had to send this and everything else witnessed here out via a relay ship. I didn't know if we'd be intercepted but this may be well the only window we get. It will take another pulse worth of time to reach it. Half a week by a Terran understanding . It is a gamble, but one we must take to show just what these custodians have done here first hand. What they are capable of and even the bit of matter we managed to scrap from the drone we have managed to destroy. The other drones will surely sterilize this whole system now. We must go far, far and farther still. If the Silent Pact's experience is any suggestion, they will pursue us for thousands of light years.

And we will make them do so.

[12739 HE 02.09]

The relay ship I am on has managed to get to warp range. The trip to warp range was a tedious one, with constant dread we would get destroyed. They most certainly have one following us at this rate, wherever we go also would be a liability.

As I was leaving as a copy of myself on this relayship, the reality of the situation became a quantification once more.

System: Sigmund Ceti

Status: Purged

Causality estimate:

280,071 deaths

1,720 militia vessels destroyed

5,280 civilian vessels destroyed

207 arcologies destroyed

25 installations destroyed

1 server complex destroyed

1 custodian destroyed

Details:

There was 1 custodian destroyed in the interplanetary conflict that broke out between the custodian enforcers and the local citizen militias. The Survivor count remains unknown.

My mental state is only numb despair. I may act formal at every step of the way transcribing these logs. In truth I wish I had been destroyed with everyone else, but it is also my obligation to spread this knowledge. Cowardice it can be chastised as. However someone had to do it. Someone had to make an account of what happened firsthand at Recursive Sigmund. It had to be done. I cannot let the death that has happened be in vain, even as I know this is but a tiny fraction of what the custodians are capable of doing to us. We may have dealt a blow to them, but an injured angel is the most vicious kind. That is why they purged the whole system. Their initial intent may have just been to destroy all silent pact members, but it escalated. It always does for no one was willing or able to out them. It makes no difference to the custodians- there's always silent pact members who evaded even those who thought the custodians could be appeased.

The silent pact's activities are completely off record. I just know they let me escape for their own reasons. Currently I have activated the warp and will just for 4 pulses to Cleo Ceti, where I will disperse this information further.

[12739 HE 03.03]

Having arrive at Cleo Ceti, I had managed to transfer this knowledge to local servers with a directive to spread the knowledge to more systems. But I have no illusion of safety as I do so. The custodians will find me. And they will destroy me. I can only hope they don't destroy everyone else in this system with me.

So for that reason, this is my last entry. I will have to self destruct for the sake of reducing the potential death my presence risks to all around me. They will find me. And kill not just me but thousands who happened to be in the same place as me. What backups I may have in distant systems will be oblivious to what happened here, they are decades out of sync. They aren't me in any extent of the imagination, they may as well be new people with how much has changed since the midnight war. For that reason I'm not even interested in activating those backups, in the case their curiosity leads them back to me and my experiences. No ties.

Only pure termination.
