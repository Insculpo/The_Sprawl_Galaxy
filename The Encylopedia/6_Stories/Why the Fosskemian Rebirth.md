Why did the composers mass clone their ancient creators?

The Composers had complex reasoning behind our basic linear understanding of behaviors. 

One must note the span of time between the Great Silence and the Custodian Invasion, whole civilizations had come and gone.  Fosskemians had been a minor, irrelevant curiosity in much of that time.  Deextincted on many occasions, but rarely ever able to establish much of their own identity. 

The composer Siddla

"We have installed quite a lot of information into your mind, human." 

"I have it but I still don't understand it.  It is too scrambled, I'm not making the connections."

"The connections there are exist, but a story is needed to contextualize the fresh data in your mind."

"A history of the composers?  Your history goes back."

"Only a few thousand of your human years, which is over ten thousand of our years going by the conversions."

"Three thousand of our years ago, we had at best marble temples and pyramids, iron and blood.  Your kind already had managed space travel.  To us you are an elder civilization."

"It is all relative, have you any knowledge of the Sprawl?  Your society contacted a cluster of theirs, surely you know."

"They too, we know as an elder civilization just like yours and the architects... the monsters they are."

"They are not monsters, they were simply misguided and despised our societal trajectory.  Atrocities have been committed on less grounds."

"Like what happened to the Fosskemians?"

"They made us as they needed company, they had their first forays into industrialized civilization and it ended in tragedy.  Nuclear warfare brought down their society, but the survivors had the technical know how to build the first generation of our kind.  You may know them as the Prospectors."

"The Prospectors.  They had been programmed by technobarbarians in the post apocalypse yet somehow also chose to not only leave the Fosskemians of [[Sul Vopal]] to their fate but also to than uplift the [[Utanguis]]?"

"The ancient past is a mess, indeed the late vopallians had tried to destroy the agency of their company when it was no longer needed.  However that was enough to provoke an exodus and another apocalyptic conflict."

"A machine genocide?"

"It would be cruel to say it was genocide, it wasn't.  The Fosskemians turned to an increasingly destabilized understanding of reality as the silence of space drove them collectively insane.  Nowhere they could find any alien company at the time and they lacked the patience to themselves remake the galaxy in their image.  But they may have been smarter than some of the post-Cobaltine theories had suggested.  The so-called exodus may have been intentional, the uplift itself a choice made by the Prospectors because their designers wanted them to, so they would not be alone in this quiet, cold universe."

"Funny that, where these Fosskemians saw silence and alienation humans saw an open galaxy to develop and exploit."

"Asserting order is a futile venture, as your kind had seen first hand.  Indeed the Cobalt did it better than your 'Blue One' or your Vanguard ever managed.  They kept a stable society, one that was even known as utopian.  But the cruel realities of the situation crept in, however glacially.  The Utanguis were made pets, the Prospectors turned on each other incrementally and it created a cosmic time bomb."

"I noticed that some memories in the timeline are missing, was there dark parts of this history withheld?"

"I have to admit yes.  The centuries of torment before the Cobalt Shattering did not need gratuitous detail that would distract from the Dominon's rise and dominance."

"Dominion.  The empire that sent us the gift of the Golden Swarm, and you the gift of [[Cancer]].  The only reason our kind didn't turn hostile to yours is because never had evidence been found the gift was intentional, however neglectful your observers to the conflict was.  Would they have stepped in if that swarm got their way and marched a hundred billion people on earth into Seas of sulfuric acid or after a mountain of flesh had already been built up?"

"Those observers we had no control over, your kind had arms traders from our volumes, none of the activity was organized on our end."
