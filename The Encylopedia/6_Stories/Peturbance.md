The cyborg man walks about the framework of [[Kusneto_Prime]] and its higher echelons in bewilderment at the kind of terror rumors that have been spread.  Talk of the human virus, the prospect space infiltrators... the virtue coalition plotting a strike.  All at once these dangers have left one vacant in hope for the future.

It really should not, surely?  He thought.  After all were we not the height of civilization?  Achieving post-scarcity, mastering the mind, colonizing countless stars and humankind being one of the few exclusive civilizations to have managed space travel on their own terms.  Why than does it feel so... dreadful?

This racing thought was something he couldn't escape.  The aluminum and diamondoid bracing ran through the modular and plated hallways just fine, but the tiles kept broken by design had him uneasy.  

Too uneasy.

Something was just not right.  There was forces beyond his understanding at play, he could just feel it.  Like the universe he was in had shifted in ways he had no true comprehension of.  The sands of existence are fickle.

All he wanted was to see the galaxy at large.  But the distances remained vast.  A journey of thousands of years.  Such embarking would be so vast all six thousand years (give or take a few centuries) of written human history would fit within it.  But still, the lack of purpose somehow existing despite the outside and inside threats had him wondering why so much ravenousness for purpose existed.  Why did he insist for this, when he had better places to be?

The pain of being high in the grand assembly's hierarchy was invisible.  The esoteric knowledge perturbed most, even with the knowledge of the prospect space deterrence mechanisms in place.
