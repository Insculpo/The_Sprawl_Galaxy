When encountered by Red Salts of Vinnunk in his venture from the inner dream into the outer realms of the endless maker's works Red Salts gazed upon something with a disc-like formation to a degree.  But it seemed to only take that form from his limited perspective.  He could tell it has more... parts to it.  But he couldn't fully process exactly what it was.  He already struggled navigating the volumetric cities of the outer works, from which the keystone had led him to from the inner sanctum of the mother.

He knew it as [[Kinigin]], he just did.  No additional work mentally was done on his part.  It seemed to effortlessly know him as well.  And he realized it intuitively, like he always realized it.  He knew it to be a visitor, not of the fallen world built by the ancient worm deities and their creations around him nor of anything emanating from the backbone of the night.  It was something far more distant.

And so he just knew than, what it was Kinigin wanted him to know.  It claimed him to be being made of fog projected from an ancestral simulation.  An emulation of humans out in the void.  A civilization that arose after the ancient worms and their civilization ruptured apart.  But he was not of them, Red Salts of Vinuuk struggled with everything imparted by the Kinigin being.  He broke apart, a scattered mess on the ground.  Still conscious, but he just had to see for himself as the illusion of his conditioning fell apart. Little substantially different from any of those perfunctory keepers of the decrepit realm he knew as the outer realm.

But still, he knew himself to be human, the spiritual essences he was composed of when entering the outer realms made him no less human.

He struggled with the concept.  What made him less real?  He shouted at the disc, "I am as real as they come!"

And than fell silent, as he realized why Kinigin showed him this.  It wasn't to invalidate him.  It was to give a better perspective on reality.

For once, Kinigin directly began to seemingly speak to Red Salts.

"The structures are new.  You have been born." it stated.

"For what cause?" Red Salts asked.

"If I knew, I would not be here."

"What do you know?" Red Salts asked once more, "Where are you from?"

Kinigin's drained influence from Red Salts in that moment left him feeling hollow.  As if he came to like the genial embrace of the ancient being.  After a crushing thirty seconds, Red Salts than knew.

And with that, his memories became filled with imagery of events far more ancient than anything he thought conceivable.  He knew there to be some... other kinds of philosophy behind the other humans out there in the void.  Rejection of the mother, slavery to the father.  It filled him with a degree of disgust at how astray the cousins have become.  But it was not his quarrels or struggle.  He just knew one day they would arrive to this world- provided the other interlopers didn't first.

He hoped to be dead when that day arrived.

Or better yet, prepare to fend them off.

Was this why Kinigin sent him these revelations?  To warn him of the dangers festering in the void?  Why did such a distant being, from distant backbones in distant nights concern itself with us?  Did ancient and vast being as Kinigin have no better activities to do?  Such thoughts plagued the mind of Red Salts.

Than the disc of Kinigin returned.

"The last visit to [[Earth]] was 12482 years prior.  You're from an earlier sweep."

"I do not understand.  I am from an inner realm, the outer realm I do not know.  You may have imparted much knowledge onto me of the outer realm, but I do not work with these scattered visions you filled my mind with.  I need your voice to give me clarity."

Kinigin with hesitance, agreed to this.  But something in the space of time changed.  Red Salts felt the world around him seemingly stop.

It froze time itself.  The extent of Kinigin's abilities was something Red Salts didn't know.

"What you know as the outer realm, I know as the universe.  The time you perceived in that inner realm was far different from the outer realm.  The outer realm is a slow realm compared to yours.  You will return to the inner realm in a different century from the outer realm.  Do you accept this, or do you want to continue?"

Red Salts felt disillusionment.  Kinigin knew so much of him- yet so little.

"We know of the ways time pass between the inner and outer realms and have for many dynasties.  When I return, I must return with something beyond what I have left.  I do not know what to expect.  The keystones open in short windows every other generation.  Give it enough time, I will see my progeny appear in the outer realms with me."

"Than we proceed."
