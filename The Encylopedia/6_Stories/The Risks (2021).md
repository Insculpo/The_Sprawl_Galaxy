"The Assembly will not risk a war that could mean death on orders of magnitude beyond all our comprehension.  Your earth has hundreds of billions but we have Trillions of lives at stake."

"You have to understand, the [[Virtue Coalition]] has been infiltrating our societies.  Inaction on the matter could mean Sol falls to the Virtue Coalition."

"You think we don't know this?  You are naive to think We do not have our own infiltrators at Sol."

"You what?!"

"You terrans never were the type to get out much.  I had hoped in the past centuries your world would have learned from their ancestors, their failures, their errors.  To recognize earth is not the center of the universe.  But you still assume as much, even as your society has been outpaced and outmoded.  Instead your kind has deterioration towards absolute myopia.  [[Earth]] is a vast population but it is not the only word of importance in the neutral volumes.  Your ancient blood feuds are of no relevance to us."

"At least we kept our humanity.  Your societies abandoned humanity.  Your are just borg."

"We did not abandon humanity, we adapted.  Our essence remains human, our outlook and consciousness remains human."

"You are just AI wearing the cloak of a human mind.  A zombie of an actual human.  You sold your essence for an advantage."

"An advantage that is why earth stands.  The Golden Swarm wanted to reduce your world to a sulfuric acid pit.  The Virtue Coalition would know as much, our own forces had once helped their societies until the Great Chilling.  It was when the Assembly sided with the [[Natvyr]] in the Natvyr wars and the VC revealed themselves as  human supremacist fascists under their egalitarian cloak.  Yet you hate them yourself, fascinating."

"The Virtues are what we know as communists.  They are untrustworthy."

-A virtue coalition member enters-

VC: "Are we butting in?"

Assembly: "You disgrace.  You let the VC representative in."

VC: "Calling us fascists, the Assembly.  Calling us communists, the Terrans.  I can assure that we are neither.  We are something outside your spectrum.  We act on the census, we act on the virtues.  We do not follow hierarchy anymore.  We do not follow greed anymore.  We are of a humanity finally freed of your agrarian despotism."

T: "See, communist."

Assembly: "Yet you do not extend that sentiment beyond your neural tribes, you follow supremacy within your dehumanizing gestalt."

VC: "The connection of alien minds to the gestalt would destabilize it.  We have tried neural tribes of multiple species.  We lack the means for it.  But we have gotten closer to equality than the oligarchic, corrupt hellscape of the Assembly which I may remind too has discriminated regularly against other species.  We all are guilty of such bias on some level, that tribalism is an all too human quality."

Assembly: "We treat all sapients loyal to the assembly with equal respect as citizens of the assembly and its affiliated worlds, your totalitarian fascist regime just lies and lies and lies.  Tell me how many natvyr did your society kill?  What of the tikali populations you relocated until the Vapourites threatened intervention?"

VC: "And what of your own society's treatment of the rasuu?  Their complicit activities with the silverites letting members your own military whore out to alien empires?  Why not invite the composers to handle your diplomacy while you are at it?  It would be no chock of They find your council's indecision disappointing."

T: "I have no idea what is going on and this is why we like to just stick close to Sol, this galactic theatre we want no part of.  We want both your societies off earth and to stop dragging us into your fuck ups."

Assembly: "Isolationism is not a tenable position, Terran."

--Vapourite Emissary has joined---

V: "A human fight, how fascinating."

T: "Oh for fuck's sakes it's a tikali.  Your kind being allowed in earth's oceans remains polarizing to say the least."

V: "It is mutual, we reciprocated by allowing humans on our land.  Our cooperation has been a net good."

VC: "You interlopers"

Assembly: "Be welcoming of our guests, they are much like us.  They too are part of the Plexus."

T: "There is no Plexus, that glorified grid of AI conspiracies being compared to souls is a disgrace to the concept of a soul."

V: "Just like the Mush, I see."

VC: "They may be also virtualized but their processes are not compatible."

Assembly: "There is no need for compatibility, it is synergetic.  That matters more."

V: "I may add that we have human immigration."
