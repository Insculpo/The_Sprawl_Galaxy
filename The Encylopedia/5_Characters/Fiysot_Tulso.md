## Biography

Fiysot Tulso was among the great inventors of the Tulso clan that propelled the Tikali to the stars.  The Tulso colonial tendril owes its existence to Fiysot, who is mainly granted the credit of inventing most forms of communication systems and filtration systems needed in the bulk of Tikali craft.  Fiysot's materialism always was a cruder aspect of their past kept under wraps, along with the scandalous tenure as a brooder being fertilized by over a dozen clans.  Tulso claimed to have let its eggs be inseminated that way to expand the clan for a peaceful Long Step, but the Minavans made such prolific breeding in vain in the end.  The Tulso "clan" (more a sprawling communal entity than a clan these days) would however, persist even in the farce of hydroelectric minavan electric current systems.
