A denizen who has been encountered on repeat occasions. They are a shapeshifter without coherent form, other than how they are a hulking being 12 feet in height. Their composition is able to perfectly emulate people we bring about, and seemingly put people in temporary false memory states until it decides to return those of borrowed. It was encountered by accident due to doing an act of self preservation where an expedition crew was careening into what it knew to be a trap, this blunder it apparently removed the memories of and instead made itself known for different reasons. Yuvunip kept speaking of someone it had been looking for millennia to find, Tandat-One. It seemed in denial over its real situation, believing Tandat-One to always be near. It followed humans around because it had hoped Tandat-One was among us. It wasn't. Yuvunip when inquired about itself gave a warped account about how tomorrow was such a nice day, and they should go see the Bloat minds at the spherical mass feeler. No one knew what it was on about, before talking of humans as mammoth worshippers that fed their babies to mammoths in exchange for blood rain which "was more nutritious for the plants". It noted that the group of humans it had been interacting with were of a different clade. It was from this the Holocene simulation was first known.
