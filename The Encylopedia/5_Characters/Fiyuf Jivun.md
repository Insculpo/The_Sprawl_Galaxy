 Fiyuf Jivun looked at the recursive trajectories with torment. The depths of which only brought them to shivering in the realization of its place in existence

So long Fiyuf had imagined it, their special position in the universe as ordained by [[Dozin]], the great crusade to spread life in the universe- one that survived even the lost Dominion. It was a beautiful vision that mobilized a civilization to the stars. What went so wrong? How could that ever lead to catastrophe? How could it have led to chaos?

No answers were possible, just that despondent nihilism that tears at any and all desire to aspire. It just became a cosmic rancor, a vast monster that now spreads... and all of prospect space are helpless but to perpetuate it. Even the composers, so often blamed, are too, stuck in such pitiful ways- in their mindless perpetuation of the chaos they call harmony. It spreads, devours, expands without regard and destroys countless cultures and societies, made part of this system so as to perpetuate it- and it is called utopia.

This was not what the Vusidian were for, the integrations were meant to enlighten, not degenerate, meant to give meaning to the mindlessness- that is where dozin is, the meaning, the true meaning. It is what is behind it all, the universe a projected reality on which fragments of dozin have been scattered. As one spreads, dozin is reached as the combined experiences of beings from countless worlds synthesize to the image of dozin.

That was what it was about, wasn't it? Fiyuf laments in their vessel drifting about the scattered greenery of the organic installation nearby. The anti dozinists sought to break truth, lock Dozin's embrace from a universe which so ached for it. But at least they acknowledge dozin. Unlike so many other societies too ignorant to bother with.  And how will they, when they see what prospect space is?  

They do not see enlightenment, they see a force which puts to an end their story, their legacy, their mythos- thrown into the blender with all the rest, reduced and diminished to but another particle of prospect space.  It was meant to be more intimate, yet it only seems to absorb and make more of itself.  A warped conception of intimacy, if anything.  Was it all a rationalization?

Incomprehensible

But needed

*What it was all about?*, the racing parts continued to ask.

**From Tiyuf's perspective**

My body once was of another utanguis, one who was so critically injured in the buffer war against the Rasufites only the body survived. My head is new, but drenched in the weight of the body. The arms are also new, hatched twins. All coming into being me. I was no fan of [[Ajenul]], so I kept the traditions alive even as the failings of [[Sadlon]] are an ichor that drains the greater body of its potential. Of which included the struggle road march on [[Ib Musudos]], the managing of Jiwarian stone ecologies, understanding the nullification passage, visiting [[Blolados]] to feel the touch of what was left of the ancestral world.  Travelled I had been, yet still so oblivious as to what I was to encounter with the [[Pidarti Kinnis]] and their deep knowledge. It was one thing to be told of the [[The Sprawl]], it is another to experience it. To be in its presence. The artifacts horded by that organization are without comprehension to my own sense. They manage to be many things at once, managing a way convert energy to matter with an efficiency that makes the oversized, inefficient star lifting complexes of the [[Kazupymian Ecology]] look like a pathetic act of vanity by comparison.
