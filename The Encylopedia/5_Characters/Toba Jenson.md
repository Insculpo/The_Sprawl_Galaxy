Toba was from the world of Hacien, an industrial complex that is one of the major Grand Assembly worlds found in the rings of Mamajek's Object, of which orbits [[Mamajek's Star]].  Mamajek's Star is a competitor to [[Gamma Caeli]].  

Hacien's orbital industrial belt host the bulk of the population around an otherwise uninhabitable Super Saturn.  Toba Jenson's parents were as he was, cyborgs.  But they were of the engineering union, which meant Toba at the turn of the 2700's find themselves like many union families joining the militia forces mainly to show they were loyal to the Hacien order.  The engineering union had presence but their leadership was a split one after conflicts over the union's support of the UAP intervention tore rifts that had even decades later yet to repair.  Toba himself was however in a unique position, as he wanted to get far the fuck away from the Mamajek system.  And the opportunity emerged with recruiters seeking expeditions to the Sprawl.  Extreme risk, extreme reward.  But it was a risk worth taking, and the resourcefulness Toba proved to have made him an acceptable recruit on this mission.  

Personality wise, Toba is someone who is mostly interested in their plight at the expense of the big picture.  He resents the Hacien Order, but is stuck playing along with it even as he fantasizes of the time when the older federal authority ran things.  That this is done while being in the very militias that did the coup makes him a loyal, disloyal member that ironically is what the militia directors like to see out of him.  It doesn't matter how loyal or obedient he is, and when the desire to go on a sprawl expedition came the officer gladly endorsed him.  He would be a prime example of the Hacien Order's dutiful militia.  Toba didn't care either way, he just liked getting the hell out of the system and is mostly blind to the reality of what he just signed up for in that myopia.  The officer is not so blind.  

**Toba's Augments**

Augments wise he's got the standard Hacien Order package of vacuum protection, inner breathers, perceptual interfacing with loose neural connectivity to other members of the group he's assigned to, full body plating with composite regeneration and support of a wide range of power armor worn atop the cybernetics including the expedition's encounter suit needed just to survive the sprawl's ambient radiation.  Telepresence into an android is also supported, but there is need for autonomous agents to handle the likelihood of encountering unknown complexities within the sprawl with telepresence automata having its limits in signal lag.  Toba also Carried with him a railgun his father had, it is an antique but the brute power of it has held up despite being a design so old it saw service against the consortium in 2550.  The dated weapon isn't primary, it is a heirloom if anything.  

**The Burnshot**

The modern weapon used is a defensive handheld caseless particle rifle known as a Burnshot due to how it fires in "waves" meant to batter (it has a configurable amplitude) the enemy and suppress fire while not being overly destructive to infrastructure.  They also carry with them a radiator-type plasma projector that is a must to handle nanite swarms, as it drills them.  It also can help with overloading energy barriers.
