Teserk is a combat enforcer of the [[Mediators]] who has a rather specialized [[Personal Combat Boneship]] they use to clear the neutral zones of unwanted guests. Teserk's been trying to keep the neutral zone in order with the clients in the region trying to preserve their traditional ways- of which have involved dozinist theology which Teserk is a devoted follower and loyalist of neoDozinism and is very intensively brutal minded even by the standards of the [[Utanguis]].  Yet even a lower ranking combat enforcer for the Mediator Gestalt can't help but in the belligerence entertain the possibilities, entertain the questions. Even if the end game remains transcension as their pack once drilled into their unified form. 

Teserk lost their arms once, they gained new ones but the pain had left Teserk in a place of identity crises to the point the name Teserk came about in reaction to a new set of arms- they could not be the same utanguis, they couldn't be of their pack. The prior death haunts Teserk but they continue their mission all the same.
