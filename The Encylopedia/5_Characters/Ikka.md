# Ikka

## Overview

A powerful [[Composer]] whose activities have been influence in both human and [[Tikali]] sectors, mainly with [[Fosskemian]] raiders and is mainly a privateering force trying to cause more conflict .  [[Appa]] hates Ikka as Ikka is "causing dissonance" to the region.  Ikka's associations with the Collectors does not help and Ikka's general vision of a massive trade hub between the Plexus, Murk and [[Prospect Space]] it dominates alone has hardly sit well with others seeking the same thing.

IKKA's ambitions have led them to plot all matter of grand activities for the galaxy.  Starting with the Plexus.
