Valvyvun is a A Mediator [[Utanguis]] supremacist that sees the composers are treacherous beings behind everything and with perhaps justified reason.  Less justified is their hostility to a lot of species that they view as not deserving of existence to begin with.  Fosskemians for one, Valvuvun can't stand them.  They talk too much, bring trouble wherever they go and should have stayed extinct as [[Dozin]] (in its view) intended.  They are however finding that the wheel rolled too much and the wheeler revolts drive Valvuvun to the bilethought, in a "revelation" that prospect space does not deserve to exist and the cancer was always the will of Dozin. 

*Plot concept*

They progressively become an ardent bilethought cultist who sends the cancer towards [[Fosskemian]] heavy worlds especially using their own fleet's forces to deploy them in the chaos of the great mediator civil war.  They resent the Fosskemians in the bilethought regardless and treats those like shit, forcing them on suicide missions and the like. 

So basically a generic warlord villain with an arc.  Someone whose sense of superiority over others leads it to amoral ethics that leads to the cancer spreading for the sake of spreading the cancer.  Shows how the bilethought grabs people.
