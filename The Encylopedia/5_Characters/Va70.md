Va70 is an [[Akyamas]] centered [[Jama]] AI who mostly oversaw a space port on Akyamas before its later iteration, Va77 would come to run the district which freed Va70 up to work more on Utanguis-Jama relations so to speak.  In that Va70 would manage a dispute with [[Ikeitans]] and the [[Sarkic]] since Va77 was too busy working on preemptive defenses.  Other issues were those who thought Va70 delegating itself to personally raising a fosskemian was foolish and "weakening" said [[Fosskemian]].  Va70 was quick to point out to the detractors, (mainly other iterations of itself) that they didn't fully get the dynamic [[Jitvus]] brought.  That escalating to Va77 joking "we recall the utanguis dynamic, we recall the bonding.  Memorable." which needless to say caused Va70 to cut itself off from other iterations.  Va70 they did not recall how far the dynamic has evolved, that was either impossible and they were invalidating its choices or they were reading its mind.  Either way Va70 stopped communicating with its other iterations.
