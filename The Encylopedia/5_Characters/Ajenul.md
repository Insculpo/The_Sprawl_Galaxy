Ajenul is am [[Utanguis]] Mediator intellectual and rabble-rouser who has grown prominent in the chaos of the mediator's ongoing unrest.  Ajenul holds to their time struggling on the roads of Sadlom Central, the near vertical hikes and the battering winds, the sludge and rapid changes of temperature, the starvation and the temporary separations that kept to remind Ajeinul of the temporality of their existence.  The comedic side, its clockwise arm.  The calculating side, the counterclockwise arm.  The politician, its head and the deep philosophy... from the body.  Ajeinul knows without these parts Ajeinul cannot be Ajeinul.  

Indeed for that reason, Ajeinul was horrified by the rise of the An Appath as a force in the Mediator Gestalt and actively worked to fight it.  Ajeinul knew if they won there was going to be oblivion and forced maiming, forcibly disintegrated individuals.  Ajenul instead presented an alternative outlook through the data streams of the Universal Struggle.  

**The Universal Struggle by Ajenul**

The Universal Struggle is an argument made that the struggle road is the end all be all, that the wheelies undermine the universal struggle, that to suffer is good and to endure pain is good in the service of forging a strong identity.  

While The Universal Struggle proved more popular among those of the [[Rasufian Legion]] but did catch the attention of those who pushed back against the wheel even as it began to roll over [[Dozin]]'s pyramid.  They had chosen to be the struggle road, one they believe the An Appath and their great wheel will fail to pass.  Ajenul became a major pack mediator in the process, indeed the full name Ajenul has is quite big due to the cross-pack symbiosis.  Still, it would be Ajenul who would send the Diplomat, the Packmaster and Zealot to get the primordial one known as [[Gavus]] onto the great struggle.  That the Urzine would interfere complicated those matters, needless to say.
