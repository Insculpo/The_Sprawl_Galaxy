Born 2077, a time of great uncertainty, with the chaos of a cataclysmic solar flare and the world still recovering from the bio plagues from the misanthropists.  Spinoza would be the man to discover FTL in a near suicidal experiment he managed to get underway working on the moon.  It initially didn't work, but later attempts succeeded as the sun managed to make quite far distances.  Spinoza's work was very dedicated to breaking the barrier Einstein set, utilizing a means of FTL structured from the belief in a warp drive and later discoveries pertaining to the nature of gravity itself that paved way for the invention of the Interstellar Drive by humans.  He died in 2188 and was buried at a desert world named after him 30 light years from [[Earth]].
