# The Signaler

The Signaler is a being found mainly about the Outer Nexus.  It views the sprawl as something that it cries out to, unwilling perpetually to believe the dream of galactic community over.  The Signaler has a private [[Vubit]] army it presides over its region of the Sprawl with.  The Signaler views us as integratabtle to the Sprawl and as potential Sprawl citizens.  The Signaler of the various rebuilders is perhaps the most lamenting, having vast stores of Sprawl archives and artifacts in various museums it curates across the major galactic societies through proxies with the general agenda of having the Sprawl or some galaxy spanning community once more.  Within the The Outer Nexus, it has tried and failed to make its case to the various other denizens to preoccupied with their own agendas to give a damn for the Signaler's laments.
