# Pa100

## Biography

 Pa100 is a [[Jama]] that has managed to be known for completely wrecking an entire planet by flipping one switch.  Pa100 achieved such grand feet by simply dicking with the weather systems when bored and than starting a war whenever anyone tried to undo that action because it insisted it was improving the situation by forcing there to be a need for trade.  Those in the artificial planet however, had a hard time trading due to the war.  Pa100 remains in the "Pa World" as it has become known as to this day with this disaster happening in the past decade and various scavengers already descending on the world Pa claims to be fighting off to the survivors of the famine it caused by making the weather chaos and making it hard to get outside resources.  

 Said famine was caused by lightning storms that screwed up vertical farming towers and the surviving population has subsisted mainly on printed gruel and each other when delicacies were in need.  30% of the population died from the famine while the other 20% died from the chaos and cannibalism.  Much of which is known to have been invited by Pa100.  The world currently is a battleground between various scavengers trying to salvage a collapsed world and Pa100's drone auto machines.
