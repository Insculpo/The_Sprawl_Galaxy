An augmented space explorer by the name Ekon Suharno of the Explorer’s Caste
One of the last generations of humanity to have a family Instead of being a human born in a factory 
 
Ekon is from the Consortium, whose flag shows their home world. The green bars represent life, The banded bars represent the coalition of guilds that compose the Consortium
 
Has some bioaugmentation like a lot of Consortium humans do. This can be seen in their cybernetic grass eyes and nose, along with the spacesuit being retrofitted with hydraulics to allow for high gravity exploration
 
The Explorer’s guild has sent him on a mission into the old Terran societies’s post collapse ruins to search for what the truth of the Vanguard’s collapse may be
 
He is anxious to go, fearing the Consortium may be unreliable in keeping his family safe
 
He is often mocked for even having a family as is, as family units by live birth has become seen almost as a tragedy.  
 
Even someone with the age and experience of Ekon is seen as a tragic birth, being of the last generation of people to have a mother who gestated him
 
Yet he is not set in old ways and embraced the augmentation of the consortium just the same- he simply does not see contradiction in embracing the augmentation while also embracing the old Darwinian ways of reproduction instead of the managed reproduction society under the Consortium has made the norm
 
His crew is small, mostly robotic but there are other explorer’s build members with him on inner terrain expedition.  
 
Indeed he is the head explorer for a whole group of ships, as going into inner terrain space with one ship is known to be suicidal with the lawlessness some sectors have fallen to.
 
He had always wanted to explore the stars and the chaotic flux of power that he had been born into with the Terran Vanguard’s collapse made ranking up the notoriously risky explorer’s a gamble that seemed worth pursuing over the other guilds the consortium’s coalition of guilds had
 
Yet still, something about going into inner Terran space in all its overwhelming populations and chaos unnerves him more than the excursions to outer colonies or even making contact with remote alien worlds ever did 
 
Usually one is going somewhere where things are less touched by technology, but the inner Terran expedition wants to go to the heart of technological civilization
 
Who knows what may await in such advanced ruins of the most advanced civilization for thousands of light years in any direction, what caused the Vanguard to fall could spread to the Consortium...
 
Overall it has led him and his crew to gear up with multiple layers of protective suits and the best vessels the Engineering Guilds could make.  Anything less for an expedition this daring would be suicide
 
The suit looks a lot like an old Terran space suit but the modifications are under the surface, with strength enhancing properties and regenerative gels along with lots of protection from electromagnetic forces, nuclear radiation and remote hacking 
 
Additionally the helmet and goggles include multiple forms of thermal and infrared vision, augmented translation devices and intuitive perception shifting based on what the user’s mind is concerned with.  
 
The goggles are stylized heavily as a reminder to Ekon of his old earth cultural origins even after his Nigerian and Indonesian great grand parents departed earth seeking fortune.  
 
However the stylization of it all still reveals how removed his wear is, as such anachronistic wear is a common consortium feature among many of the post colonial generations.
