# Hans
ï¿¼
Hans is a Post-Biological Tikali of the Mush. And is a prime example of such Mush Tikali.  Hans makes use of projected spheres as a proxy system for multiple states of mind and as a visual identifier for relaying messages to its friends and clan mates.  Hans has a generally fluid persona, being a seasonal Tikali has not changed that.  It's two red limbs are flexible, foldable and consist of many tubular components that can be shaped to hands, tentacles and really anything Hans can think of at will (keys or blades are also possible, for instance).  Hans has its mind loaded into the Chassis physically, with its Brain stuffed into this body and doesn't value back ups- it would rather still die forever so it doesn't have to pay off debts or reciprocate anything.
