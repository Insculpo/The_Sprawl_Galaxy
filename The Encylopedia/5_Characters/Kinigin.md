Kinigin is a vast intellect of unknown origin and makes use as a deep hyperspace system it developed over many millions of years.  Kinigin is claimed to be the perfect being and has spread its presence across much of the known universe.KiniginIgnin's nature is that of the cosmos itself, for it is indistinguishable from nature and had its birth only a couple hundred million years ago.  So it has been around for vast amounts of time- it has outlived entire stars, observed entire geological epochs come and go and watched life across the known universe evolve over millions of years to countless forms.  Kinigin has some activity as far as our local group, but it is faint and only due to a probe which arrived in the last million years.  It is well outside the hyperspace matrix Kinigin has formed- and so it is isolated here and we rely only have the probe's word for it as to whether or not Kinigin even exists.  The Kinigin probe itself is a crescent shaped, azure and verdant shell tied to numerous hyperspatial proxies, of which are hard to decipher due to the nature of the probe.  It can seemingly appear or vanish anywhere and has stolen data from the [[Custodians]] and [[Archivers]] for its own ends with incredible ease.  It has no known agenda beyond curiosity, from what is known of the probe.
