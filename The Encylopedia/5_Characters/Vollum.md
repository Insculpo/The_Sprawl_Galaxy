# Vollum

Vollum has a very soft outlook on life, being one of the more self aware parts of the [[Mediators]] and their made neural thought form based AI system.  Vollum is remarkably aloof.  It perceives itself as a noble being as it reaps much of its region and floats about through the thought space of many, often revealing secrets to others carelessly and at times, all too socially oriented.  Perhaps out of necessity, given it only exists as a thought form entity.  The above image is how it often appears to those whose heads it managed to impress itself to, as it copies memories and implants false ones.  Vollum is in many ways, an illusion for it gives off the impression its behavior is for some higher ulterior purpose.  Yet it seems to have no final state, no ultimate goal- just the mimicked agendas of various Gestalt members it coopts to whatever it heard last.  It always loses arguments within people's heads where they are their most aggressive . But wins in its parasitism very often despite parasites being so widely loathed by the factions full of those who adhere to [[Dozinism]].
