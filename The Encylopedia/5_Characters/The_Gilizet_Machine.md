# The Gilizet Machine

## Biography

The [[Gilizet]] Machine is a mysterious machine found in the depths of Gilizet.  It seems to be a primitive machine compared to what the sprawl had used at its height, but its sheer persistence has allowed it to survive unscathed over the millennia.  In that time collecting vast troves of information and managing the surface machines indirectly.  The personality of the machine itself is willfully cryptic, when interrogated it never wants to be straight forward making an already arduous process of translating ancient alien dialects all the more tedious and hopelessly frustrating.  It knows that its investigators can't kill it, it is of too much critical value to the scavenger societies who have disturbed it.  It has randomly murdered some of them, gave supposed revelations to opportunists only to than contradict them on a later date and has managed to exploit the upstart societies for information it has preened from them not for ulterior ends but for mere mockery of those who continue in their attempts to get information from an ancient, uncooperative AI system.
