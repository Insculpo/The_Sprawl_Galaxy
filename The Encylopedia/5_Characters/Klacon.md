Klacan is the revered figure of Phidian myth, a legendary figure who made the Consul and renewed Phidian existence after the fractured age (a brief interstellar age of disunity of great trauma for the [[Phidians]]) and ended the modern degeneration of pre-stellar Phidian civilization while substantiating a new path in the new context of space faring civilization.  Klacan and Klacan alone led the way, with little opposition.  The Consul was set up not much after and the records about Klacan have been all revised heavily in the ensuing time periods.  Klacan's actual past is only known by the [[Archivers]], who have naturally become viewed as a demonic evil by the Phidian Consul and treated as such for having the wrong truth.  The Archivist account depicts Klacan as a far more degenerate figure who was an opportunist military leader who hijacked the freer society of the distant past and killed off a third of all Phidians alive at the time out of sheer pettiness in order to unify the Phidian species while setting up much of the infrastructure for the hallucinogenic, perception oriented state which Phidians exist in to this day.  Archivists remain the number one evil in the eyes of Klacan's descendants for the lies they spread and usually will kill any Archivist they find without hesitation, or really any outsiders at this point.
