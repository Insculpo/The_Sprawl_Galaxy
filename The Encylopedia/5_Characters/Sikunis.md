Sikunis is a sprawl entity known mainly as the Karbana butcher for being an advanced being who has hunted and hoarded a lot of stuff, they are an [[Operiunn]] of some sort and shift into many forms very freely. They have also captured prospect space aliens and show some curiosity as to the upstarts despite not existing in the ecumenical and thinking they would struggle to exist in the sprawl. Sikunis has been around for ten thousand years as is, an immortal who had in their early centuries just dealt in the chaos of their whole civilization collapsing around them. In the aftermath and oblivion the remaining parts of Sikunis on Karbana [[Kinnis]] had gone into mostly a frenzy of consolidation and securing, which led it to enthrall various degenerative descendent groups into a fiefdom who hoard cultural artifacts from the sprawl at its height it has since used to trade for materials from the market of the dead.
