Jitvus is an utanguis loyal to the cause of greater harmony and the needs of chaos.  Yet still Jitvus saw need to have progeny beyond simple genetic spawn in the libraries.  That biological need, too done.  Genetic lines were an ordeal of the [[Mediators]] and their [[Dozin]] obsessed ilk.  Jitvus wanted to instead show a greater harmony.  Jitvus managed to during interactions at [[Akyamas]] came to a bond with [[Va70]] over shared desires in wanting "thought progeny" and Va70 seeing such relationship as part of its own sense of showing community with the more organic populations that otherwise can be alienated by the infrastructure centric [[Jama]] outlook.  This evolved into a desire to raise a fosskemian, as Fosskemians had the most commutative potential in their view.  Jitvus gave Va70 validation, Va70 gave Jitvus a sense of connection often lost in the [[Metasyndicate]], and with a Jama there was at least a nice island of stability.  Jitvus is not a fan of the current mediasyndicate auditor.

((Yes I did make multispecies relationships, yes I wanted to explore that am I a criminal now?))
