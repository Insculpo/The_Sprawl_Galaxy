Character Conceptions

Human naming is built on mixed colonies from the vanguard age and further loaning of terms from cross-immigration that occurred with the warring factions and the consolidation of the Plexus.

**Rikedo Yelo**

Background-Worldbuilding(human, brain in jar with androids, Assembly loyalist)

Background-Personal(40 years old, male refugee from The Estate, became an obsessive loyalist due to the “liberation” as he had deluded/indoctrinated himself to see the massacre of his family by UAP units as they were “tragic servants” in his mythology, unable to accept that he was only spared out of circumstance and the luck of making it to the world of the very people that destroyed his old world, the underlying sense of loss however has led him to receding to a server, using only android puppets to interact with each other.  He refuses to mind upload, but has transitioned to a brain in jar entity and incrementally falling to simulationism, only coming out because he wants to handle the problems of the Assembly first hand and work against the plots of the VC)

**Alice Green**

Background-Worldbuilding(human, virtual, Plexus agent)

Background-Personal(She is a virtual agent, Seve is a centuries old Plexus agent, with old terran society still with her to an extent.  When she was young, the Vanguard was still around.  She had grown old and dying by the time she had chosen to upload her mind, seeing the chaos of the ‘shutdown’ as the Vanguard’s downfall was known and wanting to guide her descendants to a better world.  Her modern virtual form is very much spiritual, appearance and form can be anything.  The brain she once had, a pickled artifact full of prions.  The virtual being’s sense of life is… different.  Alice holds to a sense of being female as a product of having died a grandma during the age of the Vanguard, but this sense is solely an abstract, identity-oriented concern.  Instead of continuing life as the matriarch of her generationally more distant family, of which would split between the VC and Assembly by the 2700’s she had joined the Plexus.  She does detective work on both factions in secret, with a calm demeaner that leaves her unassuming to others, just a doting Plexus spirit who at times blends into the servers in a NPC-like way.  Her observational branches are very NPC-like.  But the Tribune relies on people like Alice Green for a range of actions, as do the Mythic Monitors who maintain Plexus neutrality and the free mind standard themselves.  She has managed to be a justice in the Virtual courts of the Assembly in recent years as investigations of Assembly activity had needed to increasingly infiltrate the Assembly to know what they are actually intended to do.  Rumors of a strike against the VC have been especially concerning.)
