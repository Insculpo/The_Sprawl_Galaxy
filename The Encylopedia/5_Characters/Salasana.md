# Salasana

Salasana's life was one of [[Jama]] Corps AI tinkering.  She did the work, produced the results and overall sought to make the harmonious actions homely as it were.  She had been born from a synthetic egg, lost her body a several times from some harmony wars but was brought back from the memory stream.  All normal to [[metasyndicate]] life, [[Fosskemian]] or not.  Salasana's work in the [[Jatarsan Rainbow]] in selling arms to [[Veemer]] violence vectors.  Salasana's a dedicated chaos agent on the whole, and she has continued to spearhead destabilization ops in the neutral zones.  She's somewhat a coy being, but not really intentionally so.  She just is very open headed about stuff she really shouldn't be.
