## Biography

The Minava culture on [[Long_Step]] was always hierarchical and imperial, built in the fires of the pyre era and fixated on raft cities to the point of building vast temples complexes dedicated to the enigmatic [[Minava]].   Despite once being a clan. Miyupa as a persistent brooder (or girl, humans would call Miyupa a girl), they consolidated their structures and sought other worlds once the tech was around.  Miyupa would name the world of Minava after the clan and be an aggressor asserted of Minavan power and influence to a viciousness rarely seen among the reciprocation ethic obsessed Tikali.  She knew to expect reactions but was mostly saved by the Minavan world's industrial importance as the center world of processed electric current wares.
