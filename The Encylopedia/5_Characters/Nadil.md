Nadil is the name given to a human whose personality can be described as delusional.  They mostly bought into the Assembly's belief of humanity but don't think they're doing it right,  Believing the [[Grand Assembly]] is flawed is a common enough stance, but Nadil is quick to find it is more dire than they realized.  It is a slow enchantment with the higher echelon accepting them due to putting VC agents only to find out many of them never are what they say, and don't actually seem to do much better than the "lower rank." People in the system beyond just having better cybernetics that give them more fancy gimmicks.  That this was allowed to be what rank is based on unsettles Nadil, but they play along with the nonsense fearing the loss of the rank.  They'd still have the basic essentials every human would be expected of, but Nadil wanted to matter.  And believed at first ranking up in the Grand Assembly's bureaucracy and systems of duty would do this.  Only to find out the universe is way bigger than themselves.
