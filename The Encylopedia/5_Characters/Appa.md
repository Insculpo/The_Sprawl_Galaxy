# Appa

## Biography

Appa is one of the [[Composer]] entities whose reach has found its way to the Plexus.  Appa is mainly in communication with various groups in the Pleuxs mainly trying to help prop them back up to avoid complexity reversions the Golden Swarm had caused.  They want the humans killing each other again ultimately, but the situation Appa found was just sad.  Appa seems to have not much motive outside of this, at least as far as those part of the pact can tell.  Their intrusions in the Plexus have continued to be an irritancy either way, especially as tensions between the [[Grand Assembly]] and [[Virtue Coalition]] have been exploited by mercenaries from [[Prospect Space]] and the ability to have such scapegoats is not ideal.
