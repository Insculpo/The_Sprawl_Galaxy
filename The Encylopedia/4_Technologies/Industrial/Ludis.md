# The Ludis

The ludis is an incredibly common symbiont in the gestalt, used mostly by the awas for enhanced intelligence, vitality and companionship.  They are self implanting through the mouth as they are pretty much like symbiotic tape worms.  They entrench themselves and live off your body, but also give back to you with benefits such as vitality and interface with the nervous system to communicate with you on whatever it wants to.  Stupider versions don't do that.  There are variations on this adapted to multiple species as the ludis is really many species from many worlds, modified parasites made into useful organisms by the [[Utanguis]].
