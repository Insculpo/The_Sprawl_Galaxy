# The Apa
ï¿¼
The Apa is a system of cleaning creatures manipulated into existence by the [[Utanguis]] as a bottom feeder in the greater body who also can act as spies and as back up food when needed.  Their versatility comes from how they are completely biosynthetic and given a degree of autonomy in their behavior, acting more or less on engineered instincts than explicit instructions.  The Apa tend to be rounded mainly due to the need to fit around small spaces and absorb whatever detritus needs cleaning out today.  They're quite widespread everywhere, it's hard to miss them really.  The Apa are just too present to miss
