The Sarthlomist are plants from the world of Zirlopir with very bulbous properties from their shoots and their internal nucleus which fuels their body, as they are very much like some organic fusion reactor.  The Sarthlosmists effectively are a delicacy, mainly due to their widespread nature being limited to one world and their usage as a grow able fusion reactor has not been lost on anyone.  It is not sure why this is possible, but it is.  One could wire sarthlomists together to fuel huge settlements while also getting oxygen and emergency food from them, making them a diverse utility in general due to the bio replication. The [[Utanguis]] had taken them and improved on them ten fold, making Sarthlomists into hyper rapid regrowing energy systems that can be miniaturized for weaponry, civilian power and as an adhesive of sorts due to the roots.
