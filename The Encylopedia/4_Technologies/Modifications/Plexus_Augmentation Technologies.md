The augmentations of the Plexus in effect, create machine souls for all intents and purposes. Intelligences that are reflections and shadows of others, phantom spirits, memories altered and recorded are all realities for humans of the civic.

A common trend with the sugmentations is their dependency on external power sources and being heavier, meaning augmenting for strength quickly becomes a need.

**-Intelligence Augmentations-**

*Imaginary friends*

Cartoon personalities formed from collages of the memories of children is a thing that some toy manufacturers have made, these are straight forward enough. But adults using this kind of projection VI (virtual intelligence ) tech have found more... uncouth applications for the tech. Some simulating husbands and wives they never will have, others trying to imagine to being fake clones of lost ones. Others still just doing it for erotic purposes.

*Augmented Reality*

Creates augmented realities projected over a physical space layer. By 2900 this can be achieved by a simple nanoscreen layer on the eyes streaming data from the actual computer elsewhere on someone's body.

*Mind Helpers*

Mind Helpers are simplistic VIs that automatically run calculations and look up information for you. They also help organize tasks, track time intuitively and hard store memories to more easily retrieve them.

*Nanocells*

Civic nanites are an additional set of cells within the blood stream that act as better versions of palette cells, made to more effectively deal with cuts, infections and bruises. They also are often Antibodies, that have been stressed by the arms race with artificial bacteria and malignant nanites.

*Monitors*

Monitors simply monitor body systems for medical purposes. They're ancient.

*Neural-machine converters*

Interfacing systems that allow minds to interface with computers like they're a sort of the computer, controlling avatar machinery and the like while in this neural-state. Such converters are also the basis for neural-tribalismï¿¼ as a whole.

*Nanite nodes*

More advanced nanite augmentations have full on body systems built around nanites with command VI nodes that better direct and strategize against foreign body threats and wounds, communicating with other augment parts to do so.

*Simulator*

Creates internal simulations from neural mapping that allow for extreme civility on part of the user in a time dilated space where it is easier to learn skills or engage in whatever activities they want.

*Dispensers*

VI assistant controlled dispensary filled with drugs and such, very straight forward system. They're rather noticeable and have to be done externally.

**-External-**

**Metal Shell**

An additional exosuit that Is grafted in place of the skin, built onto the skin initially but layered up in segments that eventually make you a metallic cyborg human in a metallic shell with nanite blood and human blood. These tend to give general all around enhancement in speed, strength and prescience, but require you to have a high energy intake along with food intake.

**Power suit**

Large external suits that require lots of power, but can work in a huge range of environments in the name of a wide range of tasks. Often are able to also command drones.



**BCI Link**

Telecom apparatus that links the brain to a telenet system that allows one to be part of a common neural-tribe where conscious thoughts, emotional states and even dreams can be shared within the neural-tribe. One keeps their individual self, mind and personality. However, you have the ability to project thoughts, consciousness and so on to others within the neural network you are part of.

**Consciousness Transfer [[Machines]] (CTMs)**

Mind uploading as a problem has been one that petrified 25th century philosophers in terror at the ramifications, but modern CTMs have managed to somewhat find a way to preserve a stream of conciousness to other constructs and machines in a way that works. The approach lacks the reach or flexibility of the usual neural-copies of 26th century mind uploading but it does allow one to never truly die from body transfers as long as the transmission gradient is smooth. Basically it isn't a uniform stream, leading to some weirdness where you feel a split and sense of being in two places but have certainty it is your own conciousness being streamed elsewhere.

**Dataminds**

Dataminds are AGI humans who are in truth, people whose minds were the basic for AI personalities. Such dataminds remember being human and are totally convinced of it. They are actually phantom minds who aren't actually humans and never were, simply beings generated from a human mind but this is not something they'll believe to be so even when faced with their organic copy. Such minds can exist on virtual nets and transfer from server to server, hitch hike on space craft and so on.

**Avatars**

Avatars are simply projected holograms made from volumetric projections, they are an advanced form of telepresence that is widespread in usage whenever comms alone aren't working out. Some use physical machine avatars. The general premise remains the same.

**Biotech**

Plexus biotechnology is not to the kind of incredible scope [[Prospect Space]] tech is, but they have it. Mind, Prospect Space has all this tech and much more!

-Artificial Wombs

Pregnancy is just not a thing humans have to worry about. People can opt to just have them born exogenously, it has been the norm for a while and accelerated gestation has been figured out. They're situationally used with both private and public ones.

-Life Extension Therapy

Life extension therapy has gotten to the point people live for much longer than in the past, with 3 centuries of life on average. The oldest biological human in 2900 was born in 2524, so old they remember the fall of the Terran Federation. Longer life in theory already is possible due to mind uploading, with the oldest digital human being claimed to have been born way, way back in 2407 which was when mind uploading was still being persecuted but they found a way to get around that.
