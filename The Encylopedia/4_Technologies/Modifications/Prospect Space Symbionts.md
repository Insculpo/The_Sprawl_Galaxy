There is a vast range of such symbionts

**Makilo**

Makilo is the collective name for wormy symbionts that usually live within your guts.  Think of them as anti-tape worms, feeding on tape worms, breaking down fibers and other such stuff to make it easier for the host to process some stuff.  They are rather brainless, but healthy to have by being able to be "programmed" to selectively consume nutrients such as sugars, fats or proteins to keep yourself from getting some disease.  Some Makilo symbionts are even made to "convert" metabolisms of alien foodstuff or dilute poisonous substances.  They come in many types, be careful with that as low regulation Makilo can have side effects like malnutrition, internal bleeding or bloating.  With all the species in prospect space, some of which lacking guts, Makilo usually is in reference to this class of symbiont.  

**Jilikas**


The Jilika are external symbionts that crawl around on you.  They are semi-sapients and so can also double as companion animals.  Jilikas have been even armored and used as combat pets by the silver legions.  They're part emotional support and part repair, as they carry inside them substances that rapidly disinfect and patch up wounds with heaving nanites they incubate.   Jilikas are easily fed with food you feed it, they're rather pushy on that and their segmented vine-like limbs allow them to crawl up and down stuff like no tomorrow.  The Jilika were uplifted and adapted critters who were of Bloladian origin given enhancements, so they inherit their usually behaviors of "fester" where they like to clump up in colonies on walls.  Stay Jilika are a pest, often stealing food or clogging up something.  

**Budisul**

The Budisul are network symbionts, with many Budisul needed to create a skin strengthening web of interlaced cellular protection.  Sulfuric and Oxygen versions exist, as they have been found in heavy use by [[Vopson]] and [[Utanguis]].  Budisul networks mainly act as resilience and strength enhancers, strengthening bone structures and the flesh.  Budisul can make one feel overpowering, Budisul enhanced soldiers seemingly rebuild themselves from injuries that'd kill most.  They're like a body system you add to yourself and are a common part of a [[Prospect Space]] infantry unit.  

**Kitalids**

Kitalids are ammonia worlder distinctive symbionts, mainly due to their usage as ancilla-like entities that act as additional manipulating appendages and defense.  They also have important communication applications.  

**Stimulators**

Stimulators are Symbionts that incubate within them all matter of stimulants while feeding off the host allowing them to "recharge" if at the expense of the user's metabolism.  Said stimulants being stuff like hyper awareness, time perception altering, increasing lust, suppressing lust, suppressing pain and so on, injected when the user wants it to.  Different stimulators, different possibilities.  They often are embedded with the blood streams of their hosts. Almost like some bizarre second heart.   These outcompeted more mechanical versions mainly due to how they can recharge and be much more easily smuggled due to their ability to blend into the flesh to the point exceptionally invasive security checks are needed.  

**Breathers**

Breathers are a bit weird, as they have issues.  For oxygen-water species are able to, when programmed to, convert water in your blood stream or body to additional oxygen.  This does however come with the issue of creating hydrogen in your body that usually it depends on your own body systems to get rid of excess hydrogen.  They come in various forms, but in general connect to the lungs and sap water from your body to create reserve oxygen they can inject into your blood stream to breathe longer when suffocating.  Fosskemians use other kinds of breathers mainly to help assist in keeping their wing-flippers inflated.  


**Siku** 

Siku are network symbionts that can cause you to generate electricity.  This power generation is extremely energy draining for the user, and so Siku are rather high risk symbionts and a fringe type.  When you do this, you make yourself somewhat a living battery and can charge stuff or shock stuff a lot harder having made yourself a conduit.  It is often seen as an energy parasite due to its low practicality, but it could save your life as they are one of the strongest anti-nanite symbionts out there.  

**Drusils**

Drusils are emotional manipulators, they act as regulators of your hormones allowing for stuff like suppressing desire, pain and such or doing them opposite and intensifying them.  You have to communicate this to them.  Drusils otherwise sort of just stick to themselves, absorbing some nutrients from you and shoring up various hormones.  Drusils are extremely contextual, each species needs a different drusil or else they don't work at all properly.  Drusils are viewed often as liberating just due to allowing the dominion of logic, but there are those who instead use drusils to accelerate feelings, make the pain more extreme, make the lust more intense, jump the happiness and so forth.  Drusils are seperate from Stimulators mainly in that they're more autonomous and often try to read situations, or otherwise deal more directly with emotional and mental states persistently than stimulators who are about injecting temporary boosts.

**Grabbers** 

Grabbers are wormy creatures who attach themselves to whatever appendage you want them to and stay there.  They are very stretchy things, with the ability to spit out webs and snatch stuff from surprising distances.  Hence their purpose- they grab things from much further distances or grab into places a hand may struggle with.  Grabbers have a weight cost and often may grab other things for food.  Some arms on the Utanguis use grabbers to get their own food.  

**Fliki** 

Fliki are flying symbionts who stick close to their users.  They act as additional eyes, as canaries.  They look around, than come back and communicate to you a bit of what they saw.  Some fliki are just made into full on machine-Fliki as Fliki usually are just plain outbeat by using survey probes and nanocameras.  

**Kitirsos**

Kitirsos are symbionts who replace your eyes with their own sense of enhanced sight, with very good infrared vision and seeing hyperchromatically.  Again for heightened cost and again requiring species context or they just render you blind and you'll need to get them off of you and get bionic eyes.  Kitirsos notoriously force themselves into unsuspecting prospect spaces in some places, leading to the use of eye protection as a common feature.  

**Interfacers** 

Interfacers are symbionts that connect to the brain.  They're brain suckers, but friendly ones as far as brain suckers go since they allow you to interface with a range of computing systems and act as a form of telecommunications to others with their own interfacers.  

**Symbiont archetypes**

| Class | Description |
| ------- | -------- |
| Appendage | Symbiont expands your reach/adds some new way to manipulate the environment around you |
| Controller | Is able to control something about your body systems or allow it to be subjugated by the conciousness. | 
| Converter | Absorbs and expels substances to allow you some alterations |
| Networkers | Acts like additional body systems that work in tandem with each other |
