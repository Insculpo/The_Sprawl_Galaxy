Fosskemians as a species were incredibly effective at doing the riskiest of experiments, for they had sought the dynamic disruptions they would give to the universe. The old vopallian innovators cracked the problem of AI, nuclear fission and the field of aeronautics, their architecture was built around making pleasant echoes and the roosts liked having their structures be noise fests. Communication systems like telephones and even early forms of telepresence already existed by the time of the resonance war. The roosts of the time had engaged in open warfare due to how much inequality had wrecked the confidence in the system and the increasingly autocratic directors and monarchs came to let their own delusions of grandeur and fears of those trying to drag them down come to the idea that preemptive strikes were about to happen, when in truth it was never to be.

The development of AGI came about from taking older vopallian innovations and applying them to very real problems which emerged in the need to recover from the resonance war and maintain the technologies of the past. Dark sky probes and such also would go up, the collapse of roost monarchism in favor of a more collectivistic form of roost governance with AGI bringing forth the company needed to keep life worth living also helped. The downfall of vopallian age fosskemians still would happen, the exodus still would occur. For the fosskemians never fully understood the AIs they made, they thought they did just due to how oriented ones chaos they were. But they didn't get the kind of entropic outlook which pervaded it. The regulatory homeostatic meta stability of classical harmonics was displaced over time, to the point that in future millennia nihilistic composers descended from the vopallian AGI in practice seek entropy acceleration.
