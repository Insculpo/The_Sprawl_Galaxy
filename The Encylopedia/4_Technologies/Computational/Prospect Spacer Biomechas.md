**A Day in the Harmonious Organs of the Sul Usana**

When we made the sentient instruments, we had done so as an expression of the harmony.  We gave them their due rights as aspects of the greater composition.  But still, the trepidation felt within the Metasyndicate about them is strong.  An outspoken Fosskemian critic accused it of being 'genetic enslavement', something the Dozinist authoritarians do more often.  But there is simply the reality they have rights beyond slavery.  Slavery in Prospect Space is a messy institution as is, for automat and Prospect Spacer conceptions of 'loyalism' and the roles one has in the hierarchy aren't tied to ownership nearly as well.  So there isn't often stuff we can understand as slavery, rights usually are automatically enforced or otherwise granted based on perceived behavior in theory.  

In practice it becomes rapidly obvious some sapients in Prospect Space are more equal than others.  The preferred sapients aren't static at all across the factions- the Utanguis get a lot more discriminated against in the Metasyndicate due to their symbiosis and the Fosskemian tendency for more fluid social systems and noisy societies makes them lower ranked in Dozin's hierarchy (despite being the sapients who made the AIs that uplifted the Utanguis).  The general assumption one uses is 'if the belief system aligns with a sapient, they will be the preferential sapient in that faction'.  But it isn't always true.  The Vopson's swarms have dozinist beliefs but are very much not Utanguis, but they are an exception that proves the rule in how they believe the swarm is a higher form of symbiosis than the small few organisms mingling into an Utanguis.

The sentient instruments hum grand harmonies at the end of the day.

Yes, we have to discuss the life of the Living Instruments of Sul Usana.  

They live a nice life, they're respected.  They generate their music with instinctual intuition, you talk to one they will have a whole tailored symphony for you as a form of affection.  This has made them quite romanticized to unhealthy degrees in the Metasyndicate.  They are seen as the pets of the Composers by detractors, the muses of the harmonious path.  And it shows just how pervasive biosynthetics can be, even the Metasyndicate has their prominent clades of artificial organisms that do as needed.

**Metalloid Constructs**

The [[Urzine Domain]] Domain has AI and machinery in the form of biometallic plated constructs that have a harsh, geological appearance like that of shattered volcanic glass and the Whandl influences in the Urzine Domain are evident as Whandl Engineering went into their creation,  The Urzine's Multispecies civilization has enthralled Fosskemians, Whandl and Utanguis alike.  The Constructs help in pruning parasitic organisms from the growable megapoli and the potential defects in the living metals of the architecture.  

**The Vusipun Cyborgs**

Vusipun Cyborgs are organisms that are sentries in the Mediator Gestalt, they patrol along as bulky egg shaped organisms with a shiny exterior and insectoid limbs.  They carry incapacitation nanites and rays meant to sap your will to escape.  They are police automata in effect, but also are information merchants for tourists as they like having tourist types getting scanned by such organisms to get knowledge in advance for the plotting of the Utanguis (and more sophisticated spying done with smaller organisms that resemble swarms)

**The Matanak**

Instead the life is deep.  The Matanak are a mysterious force that was found in the remnants of a sprawl cluster.  Their nature is very disturbing to the locals, as they describe impossible forms.  The anomaly is known to be sprawl in origin, but little else is actually known of it and the data screaming done by Composers into the area has found a lot of Kivudite clade entities that seek to just be occupied in an endless war against some hyperspatial fragment of the Sprawl.  Their hostility to intrusion appears to be paranoia over other unknown forces, and their actual nature is still unclear as they don't like to talk or interact with any scavenger civs at all.  They don't have the tolerance of Karbana Kinnis in the slightest.

**Conduit Monitors**

Hyperspace Conduit structures are usually heavily guarded, automatic enforcement became important once again as a result, but mercenary forces have been cycled through on the regular as well.  But the Monitors are crucial to preemptively figuring out an attack and even trolling them into open and obvious attacks at the Conduit to get a fight going.  The Conduit can be destroyed sure, but like hell it'll be allowed without a fight.  And that mindset has been a problem for long term Conduits, but they last centuries all the same especially due to the Vusidians being more stable about their hyperspace Conduits than the Composer manipulated balance of power that defines the present day of Prospect Space.

**The Biomorphic Dream**

The Dream Agents of the Ikeitan Organization show a world beyond the Urzine Domain's dominant bioship design.  The Dream Agencies and their empire are biomorphics far more than anything else, the flesh dreaming festers within them.  They are raw in mind and body, a force of nature and have transcended the Dozinist question in their minds by being entirely power oriented, a mindset not rare in the Urzine Domain but the Dream Agents and their dreams are much more openly for dominion and control without any pretense of ideological righteousness.  They are one of the rogue organizations of Prospect Space and hunted against by the Prospect Spacer Leviathans regularly.  Their nomadic empire exists in the neutral spaces and in franchised formats, willing to still loan their members as needed to show the awe of their form in a bizarre exhibitionist display of expansionistic power.

**The Cleaners**

They rove about the meta syndicate cleaning up the place, but are dangerous as they do not discriminate on alive or dead things and often will clean through alley ways in volumetric spaces on planned habitual routes. They are in a place between biology and civilization that is unsettling to outsiders given how apathic prospect spacers are to a lot of things we can't even begin to risk. One just stays out of their way as they make a clear sound when present. They have been a great way to get rid of dead bodies by more rogue elements in the society, incidentally. To the point they had to be fitted with DNA readouts and trauma dilators whenever unwitting victims ended up having to regenerate to smooth over the disruptions to their psychology. Such biomechanical entities are commonplace across prospect space but these are more on the mechanical side due to the azullian balancer designs teetering that way.

**Prospect Biomorphic Substatum**

The biomorphia is the way prospect spacers cross-compat, it is not something all consent to and factions that mandated it like the Invidun collective or mandated subsumption like the bilethought were turned on by other leviathan societies who see it as an autonomous choice by the beings which compose them- for it not to be would be cancerous. The biomorphic substrate is uniquely able to materialize and partially liquify to handle inertia harm and G-forces. It also allows them to stack even more symbionts with organ layers that remold and adapt much more readily with new augmentations. The substratum is mostly a clade within prospect space in practice as it has limitations. For one it is not cheap material like most biomasses composed of common cosmic abundances.
