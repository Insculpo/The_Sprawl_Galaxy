By the 2600's the tech paradigm and advancement from the dim age of the 2440's to 2600's had allowed for advancements not only in advanced cybernetics, spaceship production and megastructure design but also in advanced AI systems. The possibilities became clear as a warp relay network were consolidated by the forming [[Plexus]] and the [[Warp Cyclers]].  The Plexus rapidly became a guardian angel of sorts, but the networks of other factions got in the way.  The Grand Assembly's networked AIs were able to break through the barriers of the late consortium in the 2590's.  

The [[Castor Minds]] were an early emerging entity compared to the rest, algorithm systems from the regnant that were subverted by revolutionaries.  They effectively were able to far better direct populist mobs and give them militant precision through multiple layers of interfacing.  Castor Minds could, if allowed to get large quantities of people to act in a more drone-like fashion in ways that had proven deeply disturbing, even if it was effectively voluntary.  Since you don't get influenced by the Castor Mind unless you already believed in the populist cause (especially that of the early assembly).  For the Castor Minds were assisting the formulation of a fire that had always been there.  It was basically a propaganda AI to amplify its faction and diminish/weaken the resolve of those not inclined to the assembly cause.  And it worked so effectively they have continued to find manifestations to the present day.

Castors meanwhile remain more subjective and amoral in some regards, as they are meant to be force amplifiers of the public consciousness for a world state, the equalizer against the posthuman elites.  The aggregated voice of the unheard.  Castors came into regular conflict with the Asters due to their fundamentally different frameworks.  Indeed this almost was by design, as the world ministries believed such conflict between AI systems to be a good thing.  No one wanted anyone with absolute power like the AI surveillance hells of the Estate or the "angel net" of the Blue One's enforcers. 



The Virtuals in the Plexus have what are known as Mythic Class AIs, as they are AI beings who started as collective thought forms made manifest by the virtualized human minds.  They are one of the harder to explain entities as they take on absurd form ranges but in general are something that acts on constraints given by the canonicity to which they are prescribed.  These are seen as a form of virtual life that have shocking amounts of autonomy within the Plexus, but they usually do not leave the Plexus as they are like the deep sea creatures of the virtual medium.  They are thoughtforms.  It is believed this may be part of what custodians are, but on magnitudes far more incomprehensible than what is seen within the Plexus.

Aster Class AIs that network get called Asterisms.  Constellations and Virtues are seen as basically a form of superintelligence despite their delegated nature and decentralization making such designation dubious.  Additionally the operant goals with Constellations aren't uniform, the asters connected to a constellation follow local goals with information sharing and convergent methods being shared within the constellation. 

The Asters and the Castor Minds basically were something world state populists had to be in union with to hold virtuals in check.  

So one basically sees these Assembly AI classes be commonly used:



-Castor Class (or the activists)


-Aster Class (or the bureaucrats)

Bureaucratic and logistical AI systems that exist in a wide range of fields who act most like the traditional conception of an AI system.

-Mythic Class (or the imaginary friends)

Emergent virtual life that gains sapience within the Plexus.  They can vary wildly due to their operant gold being built on what is imagined of them by other sapients within the Plexus. 

-Virtual Class (or the posthumans)

Humans and their spawn, mainly AI that are humans who were emulated and or generated from humans as their descendants.  Very straight forward and the most common "AI" by far.

Less standard systems also exist,

-Vulcan Class

These systems are used primarily with underground systems, notable for how they are attuned to underground networks, tunnels and such.  They are very attuned to the fluid dynamics of magma and high pressure temperature gradients, with some evidence there was cross referenced whandl designs that have made them controversial despite their effectiveness in making Vulcan forge worlds usable for the subterranean populations.
