# The making

The making are the entities of the high council to which the maddening thoughts of the brain went on the seizures of the metasyndicate's upper society.  They are service machines within the virtual networks of the chasms of the mind.  The making are unique to the metasyndicate as they serve to be served- an axiom they follow all the time for they believe that they are being served work by leaders as a tribute to their existence.
