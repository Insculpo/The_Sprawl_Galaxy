# The Defense Protocols

[[The Defense Protocols]] are the collective name for the antibody automata that come with the bulk of prospect space ships.  They are extremely adaptable machines, built to traverse entire worlds and secure them for a singular spaceship with hypersonic velocities achieved with ease and rapid changing of direction on a dime.  

They aren't particularly big, with the standard model being 20 meters long.  They are usually powered by miniaturized fusion reactors and wireless power transfers from the energy mesh that connects the various entities of the frigate with energy nodes introducing more energy into the system and the ability to transfer energy to other machines who need it with ease.

Their alloys are made from a foamy metallic substance capable of self-repairing and changing the hardness/softness of their bodies to whatever is needed- becoming softer and more rubbery when needing to squeeze through smaller spaces and gardening in harsher environments.  

They can shift between different modes of movement, such as flight, ground movement and aquatic movement.  The Defense Protocols were built as general purpose defense automata whose engineering had been arduously tested on thousands of different worlds and against thousands of substances.  This has made them overall not the strongest in any medium, especially against more specialized automata models.  But this allows them to act as auxiliaries on any field of combat regardless.

In terms of armaments, they carry on them long range particle turrets with extremely high interception rates, radiation beams to snuff out hidden targets and micro-missile turrets that have a range of up to a thousand kilometers without any special energy boosting applied.  These are the standard issue automata, and thus they don't make use of more exotic weapon systems such as resonance wave generators, electro lasers, weather manipulation systems or antimatter bombs meant to induce earthquakes.  

Their detection systems are shockingly not that advanced, making mostly use of vibration and infrared based detection systems.  This means it's not impossible to hide from them, but if you are in a vehicle you are already dead.  

Mind, this is the common stuff they use and not the higher end forces that tend to be advanced powersuits using organic crew members having to fight as a last resort or more specialized war machines.
