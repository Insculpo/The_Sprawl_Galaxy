What makes exploring an ancient sprawl hyperspace so dangerous?  For one the fact the rupture happened.  That hyperspace stood intact in the face of the rupture didn't change how much a mess of caused in hyperspace.  Vast layers of Wormhole networks lost mean navigation of the sprawl hyperspace is much harder than it is meant to be and worse, swarms of automata still seek more Marietta to continue their endless construction projects- as seen in the broke. Megastructures that devour themselves to bills themselves as a form of movement.  The process has gone on for millennia, the smoke from the rupture still can suffocate.  So it is a dangerous realm to navigate when you try to navigate outside the safer pathways in the volume.  

On the other hand, the volumetrics not being safe or predictable has allowed for a lot of diaspora and freedom for many upstart species who found themselves in basically unpredictable parts of our spatially contorted galaxy.  See, dark energy and matter as we know it in the 21st century and hyperspace have a connection.  This is why hyperdrives struggle with gravity, as the connection to dark matter is how hyperspace's are able to have so many channels as prospect spacers so eagerly demonstrated.  Many layers to access and utilize as phantom volumes on dimensions outside our volumetrics.  Many layers with their unique signatures best left I know unless one wants chaos to spread.  Which it has on many occasions and instances!  So be wary, be stable and don't fall for it.  That's all that can be said given the war fought just to make this writing happen.  Rest.  You did your part, it's fine now.  Really.  It's absolutely fine.  Just seconds left!  Yay!  Seconds!
