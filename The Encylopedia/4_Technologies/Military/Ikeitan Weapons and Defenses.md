The inevitable issue the ikeitans had encountered was that time took its toll.  The need to innovate was pressing.  First gen ikeitans were mostly in the space of growable helper vessels that had a complexity sprawl in their uses in the sectors they had been employed.   Contrary to some propaganda, intelligent ikeitans were incredibly welcomed by the locals.  They were mostly integrated and treated as just any other species.  Of which would make the betrayal by Dozin's avatar against the ikeitans all the more traumatic.  

The construction of the pictured vessel is an example of the augmented shifts that occurs

With the following components:
-Etheric vanes that enhance mobility.  The first use of etheric came about as a product of an optimization method found by researchers operating under the Ivikurmajan Accordance in the aftermath of the custodian crisis and in the lead up to the project of claiming the rubble for the war against gods.  
-The vessel is lined in grasers and disintegration clouds
-There's also hanger bays for the small thrall vessels that are used as bio mechanical enforcers and executive actors.  Every ikeitan outside of the polyp vessels by human standards is a carrier.  
-The "plate" added onto the outer skin layer that handles a lot of hyperspace tapping as a conduit system.  Due to how shielded ikeitans are; the plate isn't as soft as one thinks.  It is extremely sturdy material layered over an area that was more a vulnerability before.  
-They are fairly manuverable with a lot of inertial forces that pervade the vessel, of which are handled a range of ways with multiple fluidic layers.   
-There are cavities throughout the ikeitan mainly used for thralled crews, biomechanical entities working as a direct automated part of the ikeitan and more open cooling areas for the internal biocomputation the ikeitan minds are capable of. 

More on the ikeitan design

They are a phased growing design.  The polyp form consists of multiple organ systems, of which include the sturdier "frame" system of tendrils and hardened biometals that include the synthesizers used to produce the soft tissues of the vessel. 


**Multilayered Metamorphic Alloys**
These "soft tissues" are also a more silicate form of biometallics that gets layered up with harder webbed patterns that are generated in countless patterns to make any attack form never truly perfect, as once a pattern is found to better defend against a strike or laser, it shifts the patterns to better suit defending against that attack as a form of metamorphic alloy.  These metamorphic alloys aren't immune to particle or beam attacks but can make multiple strikes using the same method ineffective.  For the Ikeitans are so advanced they network between vessels in the local brigade to cross-modify their hulls to reinforce defenses in real time.  These hull layers are not the only defense layers of course, as they mainly exist to analyze your lasers to a degree.  They aren't naive enough to think missiles can be stopped with adaptive alloys.  

**Cthonic Beams**
The legacy of whandl thermocrystal technology has far reaching consequences.  Sulfuric synthesized crystals able to cause a burning interception beam that "singes" the target with electric interference is the main point of these kinds of high energy chemical lasers, they're the PD and a means to make your own targeting systems disarray.  Such beams get used outside of ikeitan technology but the ikeitans have integrated them as an external interceptor system as part of the cooperation antidoninist whandl have done with the ikeitans (multiple members of multiple species including some utanguis cooperated with the ikeitan during the exodus) 

**Singularity Arrays**
The actual offensive beam systems come in the form of graser systems first developed in the custodian invasion as a means to penetrate custodian enforcer drones.  They cross-connect and combine into a singularity point in some arrays as a means to produce a micro-singularity (or micro Blackhole) that self-detonates in a horrifying pulse of radiation.  The nature of the beam system is not entirely clear, they are not gamma ray weaponsno but instead somehow seem to be a primitive form of gravity weaponry.  Such weaponry is usually seen as a heavy mount weapon meant to be a "god killer" by breaking physics against them.  These are not nearly as advanced as the gravity lasers used by the custodians, but they have proven advanced enough to be an answer against custodian drones.  The composers are believed to have given data to the ikeitans to make this tech and the ikeitan wars that broke out after the custodian invasion came about not long after.  The composers had been given much hostility by dozinists due to that consequence, but the composers had insisted their actions ensured the survival, vitality and vigor of prospect space and the higher harmonious transcendence.  And they also gave dozinists similar tech when they feared the ikeitans might get too out of hand.  Dozinists and antidozinists alike remain deeply wary of composer machinations to this day.

**Hyperspatial Missiles**
One of the tech developments that had been mostly an ikeitan innovation is dread inducing.  These hyperspatial missiles are a consequence of cheaper hyperdrive tech figured out by the ikeitans and the ability to superposition hyperspace signatures in such a way if they know the hyperspace channels you are on they can launch drones and missiles to pursue you into hyperspace.  They would be blind to if a target intercepted them, but the power it has is impossible to ignore.  These are heavy suicide drones more than missiles per say, ran by suicidal biosynthetic minds who will eagerly harass your comms (to make it harder to intercept) as they get closer.  Their payload is an enigma, but it is known to not be antimatter and instead some form of fusion explosion.  The exact nature of the mechanism remains a closely guarded secret.  They don't appear able easily hop between hyperspaces like a proper hyper drive can and mainly are meant to pursue on a minor level as they know a second hyperspace jump leads to a ship that can't be tracked even with their innovations.

**Plasma Wave Generators**
A directed plasma wave conic that bathes radiation across a large volume of space that is used mainly to corrode shields and defenses installations have.
