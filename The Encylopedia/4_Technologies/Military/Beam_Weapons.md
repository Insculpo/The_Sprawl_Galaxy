**Magnetic Dust Accelerators (MDA)** 

The magnetic dust accelerators are particle weapons that flood the enemy with relativistic grain sized particles in a narrow conic distribution (some of their systems are cylindrical or full beam but conic/cylinder modes are preferred due to being general assault and with the expectation of closer range engagements).   The main advantage they have is their scaling, they can be fit onto smaller corvette scale ships and even on compact proactive vessels piloted by virtuals.  

**Power Lasers** 

Lasers with bandwidths and media attuned to the transfer of energy/power in a constant flux instead of with the intention of causing harm.  They're logistical lasers meant to beam energy to their targets be it drones, missiles, other spaceships or installations.  They are widely used due to uneven energy distribution being a common issue.  And in some cases delegating power influx to an outside platform instead of keeping all that mass in a vessel allows for more manuverability and flexibility with regard to navigation.

**High Energy Lasers**

High Energy Lasers require a charge period to get going due to the re-allocating of power sources to energize the HEL.  A HEL is meant to be an aggressive surgical strike mechanism; it isn't really usually able to accurately track targets due to the longer term hotter problems.  So the idea is to use a few high energy pulses of energy to knock the enemy vessel More than actually expect to keep a lead on them.  Anti-tracking tech has gotten disturbingly good, deception of positions, jamming sensors used to track and trajectories are done on the regular and algorithms for deceptive movement are common along with metamaterials that exist to disorient LiDAR and IR.  So the HEL is about trying to get the jump on the enemy through knocking their radiators and sensors.  They're of questionable effectiveness when it comes to penetrating heavy vessels or even stopping RKMs.  

**Heavy Electron Beam**

Heavy Electron Beams exist with larger vessels mainly, in part due to energy requirements and in part due to the actual usage- that being to flood enemy constellations with interference and damage by generating an artificial ion storm.  They're most prominently found on installations or HEGVs.  

**Microwave laser**

Or low energy laser, main use case with such lasers is as an interception system.  They used to be the widest used laser type due to also being good at cooking the enemies into begging for surrender.  And they're just harder to notice as they cook radiators or interfere with IR sensors. 

**Nuclear Pulse Beam** 

Or as normal people call them, Casaba Howitzers.  Main usage is to slice open installations and vessels, they also can irradiate sectors but that has a less useful aftermath.  Radiation beams are able rapidly "slice" in their bomb pumped bursts of energy, of which allow them to be like having a plasma blade for a spaceship.  They also were a useful deadly back up weapon for nuclear powered spaceships that needed something deeply destructive To fend off their Enemies.

**The Modulator** 

The Modulator is a laser that uses a smooth stream of shifting energy wavelengths through a uniquely adaptive aperture that can even do X-rays at the most energetic phasing.  The use of such modulation is in part as a pulsed laser and, less intuitively, as a form of lock pick when using smaller "sequencer" pattern lasers that unlock docking bays with unique modulator sequences tight beamed to a station.  Some modulator arrays even go as far as to make a secret language as the same laser technology able to make pulsed layers also ended up being a unique communication medium to utilize for a range of activities.

**The Heavy Atomic Particle Cannon.  (HAPC)**

The HAPC is a heavy particle weapon, called such because it makes use of heavy atomic particles like americium to create an explosive particle array thag devestates the target with micro-EMPs and irradiation from the bonbardment.  They are devestating to armor but lack the precision of a radiation based system, the whole point is to pelt the enemy ship with heavy elements into submission.  They compete against electron cannons to an extent, even if the electron cannon is much more aggressive with EMPs and interference while the HAPC is more akin to a kinetic weapon with radioactive side effects.  

**Diamondoid Enhanced High Energy Laser  (DEFEL)**

A DEFEL is a precision based laser system used by heavily stabilized vessels with strong detection systems that creates an exceptionally tight and focused beam meant to snipe enemy ship sensors and critical points to an extent greater than the more ablation wearing routes usually involved.  

**Power Streaming Laser**

A PSL is made with the intent not of harm but of transferring power from one vessel or installation to another vessel or installation.  They also find usage in accelerating missiles, drones and other ships with laser propulsions streamer to them.  The PSL usually is a top priority target in warfare as Knocking them down usually means power management gets harder.  The PSL comes in multiple sub types, such as those optimized for EMSA missiles and those optimized to drone manufacturing related business.  Such lasers are useful as an end result.
