**Considerations** 

The mission of many vessels, especially "military" oriented (the lines of military and civilian are in flux in the post-caste world) are built around the need to secure sectors, protect the flow of relay vessels and preempt attacks from rival societies.  As a result long orbiting patrols are common, with inertial manuvers built on brachistochrone trajectories in a local system to cycle patrol a system and other vessels in asterisms meant to protect the movement of warp relays and relay vessels.  A lot of military tech uses plexus developed information technology,  but a lot of hardware is built by the VC and [[Grand Assembly]] around the dominant clades their societies have and the organization sought by their doctrinal thought.  The VC can't stand inequality even in military matters, their vessels usually are extremely standardized as a result and built around coordinate swarm doctrines meant to use the thought of neural tribes to control numerous vessels in clustered asterisms.  Meanwhile the more hierarchical Grand Assembly follows a more superficially similar force, but do not be fooled.  It isn't a 1-1 copy of 20th century naval fleets.   The use of operator agency and mixed command ops to allow for autonomous local actions by captains is a regular behavior found, even if it isn't to the degree of "competitive rivalries" of an utanguis packmaster group as that kind of Machiavellian thinking is regarded a treachery and treachery is despised in the Grand Assembly.  It is the duty of an operator corp to act in the interests of the assembly first, not have tyrannical ambitions.  Terran militaries are more based around large numbers and looks borderline Soviet in many regards, with large amounts of low ranking pilots who are lead by commanders that are the heros of the mission who follow what the admiral ordained by earth's protector general want.  

**Drone Carrier**

A general term for interstellar graded spaceships that carry a drone factory with them wherever they go to be the carrier/hive for space drones.  The drone carriers are used in mining, disaster relief, search and rescue and of course in the military/policing.  Some drone carriers carry a databulb with them, making it more a rabbit hole of hellish conditions than some would like to admit.  

**Virtual Makercraft**

A controversial plexus vessel has been the makercraft line, modular Tetromino "wing" vessels that have many variations beyond their core module for their large modular thrusters that allow for extremely high inertia manuvering due to the virtualized pilot.  They are equipped with a single particle cannon and a compartment of aerogel missiles.  Some come with interception delegated to drones while others put such functions onto the Terriminos.  Makercraft are called such due to the ties to makerfolk, who are VC loyalists that the Plexus has to outsource their construction to even if makercraft are also used by the Grand Assembly.   The controversy of makercraft is that they fuel the argument the plexus fuels the conflicts going on, with war profiteering said effectively being part of the situation.  However that suspicion is faulty- profit motive is limited and the real reason is more to do with not wanting a dangerous mismatch of power to occur that leads to a horrific war.   Fears that the Grand Assembly may get overconfident have been widespread.  

**Multilateral Strikectaft**

Multilateral Strikecraft were developed to counter the kinds of drone swarms utilized by the [[Virtue Coalition]], with many smaller particle beams that "fan out" used by the bomb pumped nuclear fission vessel, of which is conic in shape to optimize the surface area for lining the vessel in numerous swivel mounted dust beams that specialized models have retrofitted with higher energy weaponry.  Such strikecraft have been used in a janitorial role as well, since sometimes the mining drones misalign and other times some rogue actors start trying to spam drones to make fiefdoms that raid and attack civilian vessels, if not hijack them for parts to make more drones.

**Datacruiser**

A large cruiser that is controlled by a large population of virtuals with a whole internal simulation system to control activities in and about the vessel.  It is different from a Drone carrier in their usage of smaller virtual controlled vessels be it makercraft or avatar vessels.  This is because of the long range autonomy needed to do the inference and distant decision making.

**High Energy Guardian Vessels (HEGVs)**

A HEGV is a powerful defense craft found usually in the most policed systems believed to be the target of a potential attack by their main rival.  Both the Grand Assembly and Virtue Coalition make use of HEGVs, as they are AGI operated vessels that have access to Electron Arrays they can use to rapidly intercept missiles, with lots of detection systems built in along with a magnetically focused fusion propulsion system that is able to take sharper than usual turns due to the fully virtualized crew.  They're extreme energy sinks, and so have to constantly vent vast sums of energy due to local planets/installations beaming lots of power to them as they can't carry all their power and be a constant stream of high order defense.  Indeed while they don't need the power streams, when an invasion is happening the streams allow for the HEGVs to be a persistent defense mechanism for a high priority/high security world.   Their origin is Plexus based but like most plexus tech, the VC and Grand Assembly do the bulk of manufacturing and further modifications due to the simulations that are used to design such vessels sometimes misaligning with the empirical/volumetric space they get deployed.

**Missile Merchant**

Missile Merchants are interstellar graded vessels that hold 100 Interplanetary graded Missiledrones and are meant to harass the enemy by flooding a sector with loitering missiles or sniping at installations with relativistic missiles.  The absurd amount of missiles the missile merchant has does cause concern for what dangers it may pose to civilians by some rogue actor flooding trade hubs with loitering missiles, but that is why you don't have missile merchants handed out to everyone.  The missile merchant also does trade and sell missiles when not in combat, but the giveaway offers involve flooding the enemy with missiles.   

**Missile Types**

- Energetic Multi-Stage Accelerator (EMSA)
The EMSA is one of the most dangerous Missile systems in use, it is a massive missile that is meant to accelerate to relativistic velocities at predictable targets to cause apocalyptic degrees of destruction, with multiple stages of acceleration.  EMSAs are usually not used as they're so absurdly dangerous to populated areas.  But they have been utilized at times historically, mainly in the purging of [[Visser's World]] when the [[Vopson]] xenoformed it from the hospitable world for humanity it once was and against a capital class ship of The Estate by the Grand Assembly to force a surrender.  Newer EMSA models are better at trajectory correction, but the fundamental physical issues of relativistic detection and tracking persist.  They're also expensive due to having a bomb pumped fusion reactor per missile along with a first stage of laser acceleration that while recoverable, can sometimes get rendered unusable by the damage the second phase acceleration or overexposure to the laser acceleration.  It can take a very long span of time to get to the relativistic velocities they need to do the damage they do, which made it exceptionally humiliating the Estate couldn't intercept one with their capital vessel despite knowing of its arrival for over an hour. 

- Loitering Missile
The Loitering Missile is more akin to a mine, it is spotter activated when an offending vessel enters a volume to trigger it into activating a rapid accelerating nuclear missile at the trespasser.

- Laser Missile
A Missile that instead of hitting a target gets close enough to an enemy vessel to hit the enemy ship with an energy bath of pulsed laser.  Such missiles are harder to intercept due to not actually having to hit directly, only get close enough to immolate themsleves into a 5 second burst of raw concentrated energy at an enemy target.  

- Hunter Missile
Smaller missiles that have more in common with a suicidal drone which are designed to change trajectory on impulse boosts and chase down smaller enemy vessels to extreme aggression.  They're basically more sensor filled homing missiles with some machine intelligence to further their ability to maneuver/navigate to a target.  

- Punching Missile
A heavier Missile type that was meant to work as a small scale, more applicable form of the EMSA able to basically "drill" into enemy vessels and explode.  Such punching is meant to be a way to destroy large vessels or bunker bust installations.  They're not as expensive but are not able to deliver the kind of apocalypse an EMSA can.  

**Makercraft**

Makercrafts are small modular vessels without that convenient of classification that are able to handle high G forces and inertia through the use of a virtual pilot.  They're proactive vessels used for long range deployments, escorting missiles to their destination and tracking enemy missiles down.  They're incredibly rapid to turn, meaning they are hard to track and are able to make use of a small particle cannon and salvo of hunter missiles to strike at the enemy.   They may sometimes have additional gauss cannons attached to the tetraminos to give added impulse and short range/sector infesting attack options.  

**Drone Corvette** 

Another class of avatar vessel that is more in the command role over the missile assault operations of a Maker, such drone corvettes are mainly used to command and direct asterisms of drones that need an executive agent to better organize the behavior and activities of.  They also can provide back up energy to the drone asterism and launch some Hunter missiles/use a protective PD system in the form of focusing the lasers used to energize drones.  

**Drone Classes**

- Trapper Drones
Trapper Drones exist to catch a spaceship by latching themselves onto the ship and holding the crew hostage with shaped detonation charges based on the discretion of the local commanding agents.  

- Interference Drones
Interference drones exist to be false positives to trigger loitering missiles and throw off the targeting of enemy vessels 

- Magnetic Drones
Magnetic drones make use of rail guns/coil guns in orbital encounters and exist to overwhelm the enemy in projectiles

- Laser Drone
Drones that have a high energy laser used to intercept missiles and other drones 

- Scouting Drone
Scout Drones exist to find and collect data for the commanding agents that deployed them.  They buzz and use a mix of IR and LiDAR systems.  More sophisticated scanning mechanisms like gravity metrics need larger vessels to achieve.

- Interceptor Drone
Drones that are used to intercept enemy communications and collect incoming/outgoing data from stations.

- Drilling Drone
Drones that drill holes with heated drills into anything they need to drill holes into, be it an asteroid, ice shell or space station that needs a shuttle drop.

- Shuttle Drone
A shuttle with an AI pilot that can carry a squad of virtual puppets androids, mainly used to break into and occupy a space station or spaceship as the operation calls for.  Some variants can carry a cyborg with them, but the inertia and risks of using a shuttle drone can be high without further securing the target.

- Recovery Drone
A backup drone that holds virtual minds meant to escape a space battle encounter or otherwise be a way for allies to pick them up.  The local simulation is made to be able to keep an eye on outside developments, but is low computation due to the small size and low energy output desired.  They're meant to be copies of minds.  Some lower tech variants are brain in jar escape pods or hibernation pods that can be recovered for those who find them.
