The nanites of silver legion silver suits are used in conjunction with Budisul to create super powerful combat infantry capable of insane feats such as surviving falling from orbit with minor heating damage at worst, partially aided by the air resistance and formation of a heat shield below the user, but still.  Silver suits can concentrate themselves to regions hit to distribute the blows dealt to heavily weaken and reduce most weaponry.  They can be overwhelmed with focused fire or heavy enough heating.  However electric currents can do more to disrupt their internal systems and make them more vulnerable to attack.  These silver suits also often come in conjunction with red protection that is given what amounts to EMP-resistant faraday cages over critical parts of the body.  Such red coloration is widespread for EMP-inhibiting materials in the Silver legion mainly since it is a side effect of the impurities of the synthetic metal used accented further from ceremonial conflicts that made those who used such red colorations yet still won look all the more wiser.
