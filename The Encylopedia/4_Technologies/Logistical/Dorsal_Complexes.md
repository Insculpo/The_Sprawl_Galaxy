## Dorsal Complexes
ï¿¼
Dorsal complexes are arcologies used regularly for colonial purposes by the [[Urzine Domain]], being essentially plantable cities which Urzine crafts regularly plant with all matter of varieties- an urban horticulture which is regularly practiced by the flesh and blood obsessed Urzine of whom mix this with artificial structuring later on, as the buildings without playing feel pain.  Civilian infrastructure is usually much weaker than the military infrastructure, which is usually compressed with nanofoam oriented metal coats and gravity distortion shielding.
