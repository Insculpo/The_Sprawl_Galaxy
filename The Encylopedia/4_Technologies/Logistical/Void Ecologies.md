## Void Ecology Classes

**Dominion Ecology**

The classical ecology, built of Bloladian and various other biospheres and compounded to a vast network that gave birth to the Ikeitans and Ivoltic.  

**Sulfur Ecology**

Sulfuric ecologies the Whandl were the architects of, they clash a lot but often prefer different orbital regions in the inner system.  

**Cancer Ecology**

Chloric ecologies that directly go out of their way to ruin and cull off micro worlds at will.  They are actively despised unlike most life.

**Ammonia-Jovian Ecology**

Colder ecologies usually colonizing jovian moon systems and jovian worlds themselves.  They're usually associated with organisms like the Sarkic and Pasis.  They also make use of a lot more electricity and jovian colonization than other ecologies.  

**Gamma Ecology**

Distinctive kind of ecology that emerged around OB stars from dominion ecologies that handle lots of irradiation just fine.  Dealing with stuff that harms even sulfur ecologies somehow. 

**Ikeitan Ecology** 

The Ikeitans modified the Dominion Void ecology in their own image.  They made a more biometallic, bioelectric and almost robotic form of ecology.  

**Void Ecology Resources**

Uric Stones - they're massive Kidney stones that exist in the fleshier parts of void ecologies, a deposit that creates rather useful biominerals laden in phosphorus and crystalline substances used in jewelry.  

Plating - Tough shell-like plates that grow in some places that are harvested and used for plating for vehicles and mechanical devices

Hard Bones - Boney substances with tensile strength and resistance strong enough to use in various architectures

Sap - Sap is developed in huge quantities in some places, which have a range of useful properties in adhesives and foods.

Spine - defensive Spines protruding about some places can be used for well, munitions and in tools.  Of wildly varied qualities. 

Electric Organs - Electric Organs that can be used in bioelectronics.  They're usually used in various specialized civilian electronics.  They are often laced inside stuff as a defensive measure against nanites.  

Webbing - Strong silk-like polymers can be found in more asteroid oriented void ecologies that can be refined and utilized for roles and applications akin to carbon nanotubes.
