The Blink Drive was developed by the Ramos Foundation after decades of experiments with alien warp systems from [[Aveterriat]] designs and from convergent hybridization of [[Ikirmite]] and [[Human]] warp systems.  What happened was the shock development of the Blink Drive, a warp drive system that had none of the barriers of any other warp drive system.  It didn't stop at gravity wells, it was able to warp to place light years within days and did so with stunning efficiency.  It broke everything, and that it was only the start. 

For one, the warping capabilities of the Blink Drive led to a technological revolution the [[Silent Pact]] still has yet to fully comprehend as they find themselves in what is effectively a whole new plane of reality atop of ours.  And it also allowed for all matter of spatial warping technologies the Silent Pact has stumbled into as they industrialized around brown dwarves and red dwarves where no life dwells as much as they could before the [[Custodians]] could find them.  Making missiles that can can blow ships apart from within, having a personal warp suit that can have you jump between worlds with a miniature Blink Drive attached to your power suit.
