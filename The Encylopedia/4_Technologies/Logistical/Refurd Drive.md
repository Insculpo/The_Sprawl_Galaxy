# Refurd Drive

The Refurd Drive was developed most recently, in the mid-late 2600's based on Krasnikov Tube technology seen with the Golden Swarm.  As one may expect, it allows for that very brand of Krasnikov Tube trailing.  The Refurd Drive also allowed for a sub-type that enabled 30C warp factor travel, but it is much more sensitive to ambient matter densities as the Refurd Drive is much more to the 'standard' seen with drive systems in the broader galaxy.  Efforts to make Refurd Drives, especially the Plexian Model of the Refurd Drive widespread are ongoing despite how they are much more costly due to depending on rather esoteric alien mathematics and engineering to work.  [[Whandl]] assistance is often brought in, of which is relatively scattered.
