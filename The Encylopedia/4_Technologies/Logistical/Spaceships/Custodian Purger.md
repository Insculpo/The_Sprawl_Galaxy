Custodian Purger

The Custodian Purger is a massive, deadly vessel that comes in and out of hyperspace road attack and destroy whatever it must. They are not often used but were used against the Ramos Foundation and against the Prospect, as well as in conflicts with the Architect and [[Sprawlverse_Setting_Bible/2_Sapients/Sprawl/Larona|Larona]] who they have been struggling to purge.

The purgers are over a kilometer in size on average, vast prisms that are the conduits for the entities which use them as an instrument to enact large scale agendas.

Technologies;

-Gravity disrupters/implosion beams

-antimatter missile systems

-Relativistic accelerator/temporal mass drivers (basically mini-mass drivers)

-Distortion field (space time distortion field to make themselves harder to hit)

-Magnetic absorbers

-Mobile hyperspace generator (with gravity wave nodes to lock or disrupt the trajectories)

-Gravity mines

-Pulse waves that disrupt data streams

-Multilateral interception system

-Being able to warp stuff into ships, with telegraphing

Needless to say, warfare with them is hard. They destroy all in their path and can strike from hyperspatial planes. However Prospect Spacers managed to destroy a custodian purged by getting ever more entities to show up.
