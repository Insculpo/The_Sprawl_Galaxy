The general purpose LOS-L (Light Overcharged Subfusion – Living) Combat Frigate is a [[Metasyndicate]] made ship that has a modular living module that on first impression may be confused for a window but it is really an opal-colored modular living space for the pilot of the ship and is more spacious than the smaller size of the ship may first suggest.  The life support systems and replicators within the opal-living unit and all the power that goes into the plasma thrusters along with the replication materials that go into being able to ‘hold’ and launch so many projectiles for such small ship are feats of advanced metasyndicate engineering yet by the standards of the void ecology building, antiparticle beam shooting, hyperspace building [[Prospect Space]] are seen as lower end capacities.  Thankfully with the acquisition of blueprints and information the ability to overclock the ship with impulse thrusters, small hyperspace leaps and more advanced weapon systems including spreader modules and laser modules is very much in the realm of possibility with enough credits or merit. 

Such ships usually are used by mercenaries of the Metasyndicate and often do get personal markings by those with the ship.  In this case you have a human piloted combat frigate that you get to pilot in Exospace.  Customization mechanics you ask?  It’ll likely happen but let’s first have an Exospace and progress on that is sort of in the ‘please work build work’ phase before I release what is a tutorial and a little adventuring to play around the jovian moon system.  It won’t be long and won’t have everything in it at all, but that’s because it’ll be an alpha demo.  And once that demo is release I’ll be having to work on making the saving/loading hellscape functional so you can go to the planets or just quit for a break without losing everything.
