The personal combat boneship is one of the most commonly used Mediator Gestalt vessels, they are a dangerous and ruthless vessel which make use of superheated dust laced in plasmoids and heat concentrating mists to have a vast ammo reserve along with deployable kamikaze biomechanical drones that are regarded as basically missiles in niche.  Defensive layering is handled by a cloud of intercept nanite fog which repairs and is emitted from the ship along with multiple layers of regenerative coating and enamel.  The ship also has spin modes to reduce the impact of laser attacks.  They are notably hyperdrive capable, meaning they are great for hit and run assaults and even data buzzing as needed.  The PCB has been known be capable of elaborate maneuvering that take advantage of quirks in propulsion that enable much smoother turns, maneuvering and autocorrecting actions as the synthetic ship board entity would make clear.

**Quark Condensate Pulse Cannon**

The QCPC is a strange bit of tech found on some PCBs, it is effectively a very heavy particle pulse cannon that disrupts nanite regeneration in the place it hit.
