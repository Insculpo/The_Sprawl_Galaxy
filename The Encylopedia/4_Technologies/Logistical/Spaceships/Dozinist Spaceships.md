**Bone ships**

The [[Utanguis]] have a long tradition of growing spaceships, they're synthetic crafts that follow an outlook of evolving tech.



[[Mediators]] mainly use what some call bone ships, with their segmented appearance.  They are powerful ships, with embedded miniature fusion reactor clusters exciting the regenerative aspects of the synthetic, growable hulls they are made from.  The plating is made as a ward against nanotech infection by way of anti-nanites that attack such intrusions or otherwise repair and limit damage.  Mediator vessel armors also include large risk shaped protrusions, many of which are ceremonial.  Gold plating covers some bone ships and tusks, with core life systems protected within the "marrow" of the ship which is a lot more sponge-like in feel.  Here living crew, cargo or otherwise partake in common harmonies.   The bone structure is rather clean, with a bit of a metallic texture.  

**Silver Ships**

Silver ships are powerful, glitzy ships that rapidly regenerate their hills from a nanotechnology laced hull layer with sleeper nanites awakened by disturbances that act to rapidly clot and fill in broken holes and otherwise absorb kinetic blows.  They also are able to hide gamma ray laser turrets, various torch missiles and viral missiles.   They come in multiple classes, from the master class to the fighter class all within the military industrial complex of the silver legion.

**The Vilufu Streamer**

Vilufu Streamers are long ships with glowing green radiating protrusions that span vast spaces. They're a common kind of cruiser seen in prospect space, the metallic cartilaginous look of the ship being a product of the growing and merging procedures that went into making it, as the Vilufu Streamer's internal marrow creates a habitant for the pilots to subsist on and eat within. In addition to that is a vast array of chemical buildup and ecological loops that act as an automatic compost means that live is fairly straight forward for those part of the vessel. They were first employed in the Violent Era by post-dominion factions who collapsed from the custodian invasion. More modern versions of the design took on increasingly synthetic materials as additional layers along with the nanites that had become widespread features.

**Clouters**

Clouters are a more recent Mediator vessel that have very smooth, blubberous hulls mainly used as mobile power satellites that act as reserved energy for overcharging other vessels in a fleet to prop up shields or sap energy from the jump drives / hyper drives to cool them down faster. They also can energy sap other ships using what can only be described as targeted leeching where they target thrusters and through unknown means sap energy from them. Potentially it is reverse engineered or made with [[Glinnvyr]] engineering, but it's not 100% clear.

**(loose) ship classification** 

| Type  |   Purpose |
| ------- | -------- |
| Swarmer   | Small fighters, often armed civilian levees or parts of a vopson swarm.  Little more than armed missiles. |
| Interceptor |   Intercepts and block enemy missiles.  Sometimes also is used to intercept enemy  communications |
| Energizer  |   Holds and distributed power to other ships in a pack |
| Warper   |   Opens Kransikov Tube lanes to other star systems for other ships in a fleet |
| Mechanic  |   Ship with lots of specialized tools and devices to repair other ships or otherwise  help deal with technical issues |
| Assault   |  General purpose attack vessel |
| Defense   |  Heavier vessel that defends installations/artificial worlds |
| Breaker   |  Ship armed with anti-armor weapons and rapid deployment |
| Carrier   |  Carries light ships and crew, often can be a warper as well |
| Annihilator  |   Heavy ship that is armed with lots of WMDs to hold installations or planets hostage |
| Manipulator   |  Information warfare dedicated vessels  |
| Commander |    Comm ship that acts on a strategic level with high ranking officials |
| Master  |   Powerful personal vessel of the highest ranking officials that act for morale and strong tactical strikes |

**Civilian Spaceships**

| Type    |     Purpose  |
| -------- | ---------|
| Commuter |     Personal Transport |
| Miner |      Controls mining probes, ferries miners  |
| Surveyor |     Exploration mainly, void ecologies have a lot still undiscovered |
| Patroller |     Enforcers for local systems |
| Breeder |     Mobile shipyards and nurseries  |
| Merchant |     Collects a wide range of stuff to sell elsewhere.  May also smuggle |
| Bioformer |     Biotech specialized vessel that experiments with and modified local ecologies |
| Tester |     Experimental vessels that test various fringe technologies |
| Exterminator |     Deals with the extermination of unwanted pests that fester about a place |
| Purifier |     Specialized exterminators that deal directly against the cancer itself |
