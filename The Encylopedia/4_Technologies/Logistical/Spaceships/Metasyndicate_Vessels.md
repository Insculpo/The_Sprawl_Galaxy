## Energetic Biovessel

Energetic Biovessels are a common sight in the metasyndicate and are a high level form of the grow crafts who follow a rapidly regenerating, miniaturized fusion overload model of development that is highly unstable and they often explode in tiny, tiny radioactive explosions compared to tiny supernovae.  

Energetic biovessels are a regular feature of the metasyndicate despite that, and are a source of many chaotic events due to an ability to distort energy flows and redirect phantom minds or even subsume them to a bigger thought zone.   These biovessels often can be living and is just one example of the cyborgized nature of metasyndicate systems for the AI remains based on carbon wiring instead of neuron wiring.  The [[Metasyndicate]]'s biotech has lots of signs of being borrowed from [[Ikeitans]], who historically did invade the "Flamboyance" region from the ecumenical.

## Glow crafts

ï¿¼
The glow crafts are a common sight among the Metasyndicate, being a bio metallic frame oriented shuttle system and this is just one of thousands of variants, as they come in color varieties unimaginable from human perception.  They tend to be easy to mass produce and are used regularly by civilians with a cockpit module which is interchangeable for the client species.  Tool modules for trade oriented, resource collection and ritual orientation along with a huge range of novelty systems are also utilized heavily.  They are notable for they rapid self-repairing properties and their absence of a energy shield system, even if they have magnetic hover induction engines and ion based thruster systems for the civilian orbital transport which they tend to engage in across the orbital cities.  Criminal syndicates have retrofitted them for smuggling and raiding among the traffic as well, along with all matter of terrorist organizations due to the easy reproducibility of glow ships- which you can make in your backyard by feeding it lots of material and sunlight with the easily purchased parts.

## Resonance crafts

The much stranger Metasyndicate crafts, piloted as avatars by composers or by high ranking/rich members of their society.  They have a very limited reality distortion capability mixed with very advanced hacking/subversion capabilities to take over the media of any world they come across.  They also make use of a anti-particle array system, energy barriers and gamma ray based energy shotguns atop of their rapid 25C FTL system.  They are truly the height of composer engineering and are feared ships in general, especially due to their capability for chaos at any scale and their incredibly manipulative pilots who are vanguards of the harmony and masterminds of the metasyndicate.  While they share the general arrow shape, they do vary a lot in how they look anyways- [[Sotus]] for instance identifies a lot with its resonance craft and so gave its resonance craft an actual face.
