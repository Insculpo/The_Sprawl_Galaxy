The T77 "Fleetbreaker" is an assault cruiser built as a frontline combat vessel. It has been engineered mainly for the purpose of provided a reliable, strong vessel that can stay in the game and ward off most forms of rogue vessels. It is rated for interstellar travel mainly to enable the capacity for it to retreat and regroup as needed for longer protracted interstellar wars. Due to the complexities of long term space conflicts it is made with livability in mind, Including a localized simulation system and hydroponics centers along with backup solar power and nuclear fuel cells should the main fusion reactor be subterfuges. It is meant to also hold a thousand operators with a dozen commanders due to the drone control mechanisms all assault class vessels have, be it the cruisers, warp carriers or frigates . Every spaceship in the 2700's is to a degree a drone carrier, it is a given aspect of the highly automated operations that go on in such large 700 meter long vessels.

These vessels were first manufactured around the end of the Grand Assembly-Estate war as "the pride of mamajek", something made to compete against the Caeli Class Warp Crusiers even as they in the current UAP fleet composition proved to be in their own niches.

Modular Armaments

**Electromagnetic Accelerator Carriage**

A modular device that can be detached from the main ship to make "mines". They are tubes of ionized neodymium that are able to modulate the charge of the package they project based on AI commands to match the force needed to destroy a given target based on calculations on their hull. This optimization means they can use less energy to destroy a weaker target just fine, with the mass of the EAC's payload also being molded to fit the given target. The heavy metallic molding gets rapidly solidified by the internal heating of the EAC's loading chamber. Some models omit this feature in favor of a bulkier "ammo set loader" that is regarded as faster firing due to not needing to do any molding did the "optimal killing projectile" which was mainly the byproduct of the main spaceship building guild stationed at Prime convincing the UAP of the value of "optimal projectiles" and how the over-performance of Grand Assembly vessels in the Estate made it appear correct even when there was no way the Grand Assembly ever was going to lost the last conflict with the Estate at that point. Still multi-loader carriages see plenty of use despite the "dynamic projectile" gimmick being memetically spread.
