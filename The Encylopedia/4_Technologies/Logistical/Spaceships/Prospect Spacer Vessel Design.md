**An agent vessel**

Prospect Spacers are in space combat radically different in how they do it from the large regimental hierarchies of the [[Phidians]] and Plexus. While historically they employed similar heavily regimental space fleets in the "30th generation space war" paradigm as it were.  Post-merc, post-faction, post-self.  Instead in the place of all that is a paradigm of violence loosely directed by the Composers and assisted by the Conductors for the greater cosmic goal of entropic bliss.  They are mocked as puppets of the Composers, but the Composers nor their Agents remotely see it that way.  Instead to the Composers, it is an alignment of interests that are reached and all the Composers really do is enable those who are willing to act in the name of the greater cosmic harmony.  They enable interesting behavior so as to keep the universe from going silent, and keep the cosmic music playing across all space-time.

As a result there is no single agent vessel.  Instead one sees various templates made by competing organizations part of prospect space of various orders and legacies.  The [[Metasyndicate]]'s own corporate entities, the Dozinist orders and Biomorphic rogues- all provide whether they know it or not the tools which the Agent utilizes to achieve the harmonious game.  Each agent has their "why" they did this.  And "why" they are like this.  Some are driven in the belief they can alone make a difference in the universe, others are merely sadists.  They are all enabled the same, even at times actively clashing against each other in the harmonious warfare which breaks out in the Metasyndicate when the logic contradictions and conflicts of interest get too overbearing and it is clear not even an entire galaxy can be shared by certain agents.

Agents are not as individualistic as [[Glinnvyr]], they usually are in small associations and exclusive organizations.

**Accelerational fluidic states**

One of these stranger concepts is the fluidic state, this is another symbiotic capability inabled by networked organisms that allow someone to handle far more inertial forces rhaj they naturally ever could through doing a form of inertial dampening through "tarring", where you do splatter but the symbionts unsplatter you. You stay I. A superposition between life and death in these pods. The hard hitting forces are manipulated in such way as to reverb you back into a coherent formation.
