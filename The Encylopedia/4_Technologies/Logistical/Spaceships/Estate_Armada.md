# Estate spaceships

Examples of spacecraft from The Estate

## Estate Siege Cruisers (male)

The Cruisers of the Estate are high order war machines, being loaded with mass drivers, numerous missile batteries and bursting particle beams.  They're built to siege space stations, so they are heavily armored up and loaded with interceptors so they can persist in missile swarms to bear down upon and crush their opponents.  A group of Estate cruisers can devastate a whole star system in short order, especially when aided by other estate ships.  Such siege cruisers in peace time are often repurposed into mining vessels, as the same carrying capacity for missiles makes them valued as mining rigs.

## Avatar Ships (either- bespoke ships)
￼
Avatar ships are the personal frigates of the estate's elite.  They're piloted by proxy minds of the elite and make use of various rail guns and particle turrets.  They also have the special capability of doing small warp jumps within gravity wells likely using second hand power drives taken from alien societies.  They handle well and are very Bespoke ships, with no two truly being the same as they're the personal frigates of the highest echelons of elite society acting mainly as command ships for the rest of a local brigade.  They are often a bit too willing to directly engage the enemy, for they believe they can gain power within the power hierarchy of the estate through such stunts.  Such stunts are deeply risky and often discouraged, but they happen regardless.  The Kidnappings of proxy AIs is a major liability and lots of data leaks can result from a captured avatar.  Which is why they usually try to purge themselves if captured, but there are ways to stop that.  Like making a copy of their mind without them being aware of it.  

## Glossers (female)
￼
The gendered nature of the Estate is so aggressive that even ship classes are male and female, with men and women expected to follow that binary and separate into being pilots for male or female vehicles.  This leads to lots of weird post gov stereotypes about gender in the Estate, so take the Glosser as you will.

The Glosser is a specialist ship made for information warfare and subterfuge.  Taking Proxymind hostages is an example of what they do.  Similarly the Glosser has various particle weapons and scatter cannons to fend off enemies but they're not made for direct warfare instead existing as a signal distortion, interception and abduction craft.  They are also coordinators to some level, but are expected to be subjected to the local avatar ships and only take local command if no avatar ships are around to continue an objective.

## Interceptors (male)

￼
Interceptors are a very basic ship, they're combat frigates that can speed in and destroy enemy defenses.  The Interceptor is lightly defended, but have overclocked engines making them able to be like missiles once they run out of ammo.  Their ships usually consistent of gauss weapons and lasers meant to blow off interception turrets of enemy space craft or otherwise act as a mass attack.  They often are working in conjunction with other ships, and are very team oriented players who will swarm their opponents.  Interceptors make use of their existence very much as human piloted ships, and are rather expendable.  Many people from many worlds often find themselves using interceptors to fend their homeland against threats to the Great Estate and their home cylinder.  Pilots can often be found to have disturbingly archaic attitudes and are an all male force, as Interceptors are male ships in the minds of the Estate.

## Healers (female)
￼
The Healers are specialists like all the female ships tend to be.  They make use of repair missiles which apply composite gels to the target ally ships and have additional escape pods they can send the glossers and siege cruisers.  They are often the ships low ranking women of the Estate gender binary are given and have medical bays as well.  They're also recruitment ships, going around to get people to join the Estate either voluntarily or out of their obligations to the Estate.  Depends on the mood and needs of the local elite.  Healer ships are not well armed, but they're meant to be reliant on other ships and stay behind enemy lines as they're not trusted much.  They're often assumed to "heal enemy ships" if not kept behind other ship
