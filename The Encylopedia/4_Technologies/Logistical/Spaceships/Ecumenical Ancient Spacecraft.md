**[[The Sprawl]] systems of tech**

Sprawl Combat vessels, or the "Ri Jimm" types are very much a valued possession, they are as advanced as defense automata but these vessels are believed to be basically the common standard for sprawl warships. They are refined, durable and multifunctional combat vessels that likely were meant to be used in larger groups than what individual instances of the vessel remain.  Having one to the Sprawl is like having a nuclear bomb.  To be fair, that's the case for every spaceship.  The difference between a Kt nuke and a Gt nuke.

-Gravity Drive

-Hyperkinetics

-Pulse Flayer

-Barriers

-Disintegration cannon (basically nanite flayer that floods a region of space with nanites that can converge into combat drones than disperse back as needed)

-Hyperspatial drifting (temporary jump in and out of hyperspace)

**Gravity drives**

Gravity drives are simply put near reaction-less drive systems that can rapidly accelerate/decelerate through unknown means. However it evidently is a form of soft warp drive that still is partially in the physical world. Such shiftiness with systems that cut paths through space time is a recurrent theme in these extremely, extremely destructive vessels. Just one can slag entire star systems absent any further defense.
