**Overview**:

The warp cyclers are 70 meter vessels which have been in widespread use since the Plexus Neutrality Accordance and the decades of iteration that came with making them.  The whole purpose of the warp cycler is in effect to give a persistent flux of data even with the constraints of warp drive travel and the absence of any massless FTL.  

**Structure**:

A warp cycler is not a complex vessel. They were made to be no more vessels with a databulb and a warp collar. And the design reflects this, with a core prism shaped body that at its stern has a massive spherical databulb 20 meters in height and a warp collar fastened not far behind it, with the engine, power cores and RCS stored not far behind. The engine utilized is a beam thruster, of which is useful in acting as an emergency defense beam should the security forces fail and the bulb demands it of the skeleton crew in the CIC. The CIC is fastened within the warp collar itself, where maintenace detachments and crew access can be found. A relay ship usually only has 2-3 crew members who aren't virtuals, with the databulb running whatever software the virtual minds within want of it. Usually virtuals do not interfere with the skeleton crew, as they either are preoccupied with fantasy simulations or existing in a time dilated state.

**Operations**:

The warp drive mechanism itself is spin based, as the fluctuations of the warp generator require an internal G force to ignite and define the vector for warp drive travel.  Once established the matters of interstellar travel get much more concerning. For one these vast stores of streamed data have become often targeted for a vast slate of reasons by unscrupulous actors, meaning a strict warp system is utilized where they cycle between only 2 systems. This bottlenecking has made such delay vessels more secure, as they station their data streaming at defensive faculties where they may freely stream data until their cycling back to the connected star system is needed. The usual need is that another unit of the group of relay ships utilized by the two star systems has entered that star system, freeing the cycler to warp with less disruption than warping before another relay ship arrives.

Warp Relay Vessel (WRV) revised

A WRV trails a krasnikov tube at subliminal velocities to a destination.  They usually get used to setup krasnikov tube links between star systems and establish said connection.  They are very shaky shortcuts, and so the need to keep a constant flow of cycles means only some systems make use of them despite the very rapid transmission of information a krasnikov tube offers.
