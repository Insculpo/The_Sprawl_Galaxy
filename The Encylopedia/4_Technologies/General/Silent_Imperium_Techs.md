# The Blink Drive
￼
The Blink Drive was developed by the Ramos Foundation after decades of experiments with alien warp systems from unknown sources and from convergent hybridization of [[Ikirmite]] and [[Human]] warp systems.  What happened was the shock development of the Blink Drive, a warp drive system that had none of the barriers of any other warp drive system.  It didn't stop at gravity wells, it was able to warp to place light years within days and did so with stunning efficiency.  It broke everything, and that it was only the start.  

For one, the warping capabilities of the Blink Drive led to a technological revolution the Silent Pact still has yet to fully comprehend as they find themselves in what is effectively a whole new plane of reality atop of ours.  And it also allowed for all matter of spatial warping technologies the Silent Pact has stumbled into as they industrialized around brown dwarves and red dwarves where no life dwells as much as they could before the Custodians could find them.  Making missiles that can can blow ships apart from within, having a personal warp suit that can have you jump between worlds with a miniature Blink Drive attached to your power suit.

## Explorer Agent vessels

The EAV line of space craft is the common domain of the Silent Pact and the deeply foreboding nature of their appearance is to be dreaded for their reality bending nature and impossibility to escape- having a FTL system which moves at a vast 107x the speed of light; meaning it takes just a few days for it to travel an entire light year- this puts it at speeds comparable to some wormholes and makes hyperspace towers impractical in many cases.  This drive system is the founding technology of the Silent Foundation and is a critical system for them, just because of how it enables their very existence and ensures that the Custodians do not have an easy time locating them as yes, this jump drive system is rapid enough to exceed velocities which the ancients had managed- 96x the speed of light is what Custodians have.  

The Explorer Agent Vessel has install a vast range of distortion abilities, mainly a spatial warping stealth system and a shielding system which relies on distorting space time to make it harder to hit.  Both such developments being emergent from that very jump drive tech they use.  Offensively it makes use of anti-matter micro missile swarms and particle beams, though such weaponry is proclaimed as defense.  It's armoring system is notoriously weak however- even human tech from the 21st century can bust a hole in it with a well aimed nuclear warhead in a soft region.  The trick is the vessel is near impossible to hit due to its stacked defenses and maneuverability.  These vessels usually come loaded with multiple shuttle craft for land exploration that include backup minds and the ship itself has a internal virtual net, which is able to connect to certified clients as per usual.  



# Warp Suits
￼
Warp Suits are a recent Silent Pact innovation which makes use of personalized Blink Based warp systems to allow for FTL jumps between regions on a planet, being anywhere on the planet in milliseconds and warp fragging into other entities.  The Warp Suits are a variation on standard combat shells and come in Human or Tikali variants primarily with variants for other body forms still in the works due to less demand.  Warp Suits have been used mainly for diplomatic functions and infiltration and not frequently, mainly out of security concerns and because the use of Blink drives in suits is extremely expensive.  Less advanced warp drive based versions have also found use as a means to commute between space stations however.
