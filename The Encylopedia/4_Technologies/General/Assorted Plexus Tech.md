Plexus Technology

-Neural-silicate substrate (NSS) is the most common standard for computation in the Plexus due to its extremely effective cross-compatibility with nerves and even has managed modulations that can adapt cybernetics to analogous nervous systems of some of the alien life encountered by Plexus explorers and imperialists.  It is really good with processing but is notorious for being a heat heavy mechanism where coolant is lots of energy flux is needed relative to other computation standards.  Still, it is effective and has led to a need for elementally saturated desert worlds with the Civic.  One that is why the Stevik became so useful…

-Mass production of cybernetics, mass production of cybernetics is one of the major things humans have managed in their efforts to bridge tech gaps with other civs.  Vast factories construct them, layers of cybernetics conjoined together in gleeful and at times, ornate biomechanical engineering.  It has become a fashion of sorts.  Such production methods with fabricators have found use in drone tech as well. (See: [[Plexus_Augmentation Technologies]])

-Consciousness flow, the emergent phenomena of human conscious flow has been solved for and this has been used to make effective Moravec transfers for brain in jar cybernetics.  It has even been utilized for BCI hives, which are networks of people linked to a an invasive collective where thoughts and mind interact technopathically.  The size of them has dropped even in the Virtue Coalition, where they often number in the thousands or “tribe” population sizes instead of the millions once dreamed of and envisioned- to disastrous results.  Uploaded minds operate with server complexes where a consistent, persistent conscious state streams itself with avatars to virtual and physical realms based on their state of mind.

-Artificial General Intelligence, AI systems based on neural networks and emulators of various animal minds whose psychology was valued for specialized functions (such as the managerial aspects of bees) have taken on an integral role in the management of cities, spaceships, Plexus servers and so forth. (see: [[AGI in the Plexus]])

-Electromagnetic Drivers, The Plexus with the silicate mastery they had achieved managed to create rather advanced miniaturized magnets which enabled Lofstrom loops along with railgun, mass driver and electrolaser based weaponry.  Such tech also had been used to make advanced composite alloys for cyborgs. 

-Micromissiles, miniaturized missile technology has been used for gyrojet weaponry with specialized explosive payloads.  They also are useful for interception and assassination, being little drones in practice.

-Theory of photonic cryptography, Ikirmite cryptographics have been utilized for the security of the Plexus which have made the Ikirmites a critical aspect of Plexus civilization and the Manifold a prominent entity. 

-Blink Drives, the Silent Pact didn’t invent them, but the rogue architect’s activities in the Ramos Foundation allowed for a collaborative scandal of tech sharing that violated the custodian protocols.  The blink drive destroyed what was known about technology.  It allowed for a blink drive to go everywhere.
