Prospect Spacers thanks to the multispecies civ they have, have a lot of horizontal tech space despite the biotech heavy slant of their civilization.  The contributions of so many species has led to very advanced tech, but it also has led to a scattered redundancy and lack of standardization compared to other civilizations. 

-Biocrystal-Quantum Computation (BQC), the dominant paradigm Prospect Spacers use used to be CACs, Carbon-Analog Computation but with mastery of quantum computers during the Cobaltine epoch the old Vopallian computation paradigm was displaced by the chaos of CQC, such paradigm shirt applied to the old Prospector Probes was part of what provoked ancient version wars.  Eventually with the [[Utanguis]], BQCs became prevalent as the Vusidians ([[Whandl]] in particular) figured out computation methods that better worked with their symbionts through the use of growable diamond crystals (DQCs) that the bioengineering advancements of the Prospect Spacers managed to have be mass producible for the vast quantities their civilizations need.

-ASI, The DQCs of Vusidian design indirectly were responsible for the paradigm of the Composers who would alternative between DQC, CQC and CAC for different melodies of probability as they perceived it.  The Composers were an ASI by the intents and definitions of this setting.  The Composers had the capacity to analyze vast complex systems in ways unthinkable to humans.  They are mostly in the [[Metasyndicate]], but their activities are widespread in practice and [[Composer]] activities have spread even to the Plexus.  ASI entities make use of many other intelligences, in many regards other entities not themselves as a substrate of the ASI entity who interlinks with the prospect spacers in ways hard to actually determine.  It is not invasive like BCI, it is more like they loosely monitor and only directly interact when they are trying to knock dominos down.  Otherwise their agents do the bulk of the work.

-Void life, the production of void ecologies is a common hallmark of Prospect Spacers, especially with how they densely colonize many celestial bodies in a star system including the asteroids where organisms that drift across the AU fill the system with their activities, pollenators and polyps. 

-Mass Production of Antimatter, Antimatter production mechanisms had been figured out over time.  The main way they do this is with containment beams and plasma fields, with ‘converging beams’ and antimatter engines being utilized everywhere.

-Beam technology, Prospect Spacers have a rainbows worth of beam technologies they use.  With beams so microscopic having lasers shot at cancer (which is a common inconvenience for prospect spacers, a need to scrub it is constant) is a common surgery method.

-Synthetic Organisms, synthetic symbionts, parasites, universal substrate organisms and leviathan scale spacecraft with high intelligence on have been figured out over the millennia by prospect spacers.  Prospect Spacer tech also has managed to create synthetic fluids for ‘wet rocketry’ that is extremely cheap and surprisingly effective.

-Plasma Technology, Prospect Spacers have fusion based power as well and not only have fusion but also managed to create seeded plasma generators for ‘shields’ that reflexively flare up and even plasma cannons that more advanced military vessels in [[Prospect Space]] will use even as a lot of prospect spacers prefer cheaper and less opulent synthetic cannon weapons.

-Nanite Technology, nanotechnology in Prospect Space is rather advanced due to being basically enhancements and augmentation of microbial nanites already provided by nature, with symbionts who forge it and whole organ layers dedicated to such biochemical nanites that carry out a vast range of useful functions like regeneration of body parts and such.

-Mutagenic Technology, Mutagenics as a field of bioengineering that revolves around technology able to alter/mutate/upgrade itself autonomously.  Such technology is valued due to its flexibility and adaptability, even if it have issues being cooperative at times.

-Bioforming Technology, Prospect Spacer biotech is so elaborate and advanced they have cracked bioforming technology that impacts who worlds.  So advanced is this tech they made xenoforming WMDs.

-Hyperspace Generators and Shift Drives are the FTL they use.  Hyperspace Generators need shortcuts.  Shift Drives are basically a form of warp drive that can create a krasnikov tube and be so large scale orbital ring sized Shift Drives have been managed for making nomadic planet societies (with the An Appath the most notorious instance).
